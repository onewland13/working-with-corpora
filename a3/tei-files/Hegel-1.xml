<head>Preface.</head>

<p>
I here offer a translation of the third or last part of
Hegel's encyclopaedic sketch of philosophy,&mdash;the <hi rend='italic'>Philosophy
of Mind</hi>. The volume, like its subject, stands
complete in itself. But it may also be regarded as
a supplement or continuation of the work begun in my
version of his <hi rend='italic'>Logic</hi>. I have not ventured upon the
<hi rend='italic'>Philosophy of Nature</hi> which lies between these two.
That is a province, to penetrate into which would
require an equipment of learning I make no claim to,&mdash;a
province, also, of which the present-day interest would
be largely historical, or at least bound up with historical
circumstances.
</p>

<p>
The translation is made from the German text given
in the Second Part of the Seventh Volume of Hegel's
Collected Works, occasionally corrected by comparison
with that found in the second and third editions (of 1827
and 1830) published by the author. I have reproduced
only Hegel's own paragraphs, and entirely omitted the
<foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Zusätze</foreign> of the editors. These addenda&mdash;which are in
origin lecture-notes&mdash;to the paragraphs are, in the text
of the Collected Works, given for the first section only.
The psychological part which they accompany has been
barely treated elsewhere by Hegel: but a good popular
<pb n='vi'/><anchor id='Pgvi'/>
exposition of it will be found in Erdmann's <hi rend='italic'>Psychologische
Briefe</hi>. The second section was dealt with at
greater length by Hegel himself in his <hi rend='italic'>Philosophy of
Law</hi> (1820). The topics of the third section are largely
covered by his lectures on Art, Religion, and History
of Philosophy.
</p>

<p>
I do not conceal from myself that the text offers
a hard nut to crack. Yet here and there, even through
the medium of the translation, I think some light cannot
fail to come to an earnest student. Occasionally, too,
as, for instance, in §§ 406, 459, 549, and still more in
§§ 552, 573, at the close of which might stand the
words <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>Liberavi animam meam</foreign>, the writer really <q>lets
himself go,</q> and gives his mind freely on questions
where speculation comes closely in touch with life.
</p>

<p>
In the <hi rend='italic'>Five Introductory Essays</hi> I have tried sometimes
to put together, and sometimes to provide with
collateral elucidation, some points in the Mental Philosophy.
I shall not attempt to justify the selection of
subjects for special treatment further than to hope that
they form a more or less connected group, and to refer
for a study of some general questions of system and
method to my <hi rend='italic'>Prolegomena to the Study of Hegel's
Philosophy</hi> which appear almost simultaneously with
this volume.

<head>Essay I. On The Scope Of A Philosophy Of Mind.</head>

<p>
The art of finding titles, and of striking out headings
which catch the eye or ear, and lead the mind by easy
paths of association to the subject under exposition, was
not one of Hegel's gifts. A stirring phrase, a vivid or
picturesque turn of words, he often has. But his lists
of contents, when they cease to be commonplace, are
apt to run into the bizarre and the grotesque. Generally,
indeed, his rubrics are the old and (as we may be
tempted to call them) insignificant terms of the text-books.
But, in Hegel's use of them, these conventional
designations are charged with a highly individualised
meaning. They may mean more&mdash;they may mean less&mdash;than
they habitually pass for: but they unquestionably
specify their meaning with a unique and almost
personal flavour. And this can hardly fail to create
and to disappoint undue expectations.
</p>

<div>
<head>(i.) Philosophy and its Parts.</head>

<p>
Even the main divisions of his system show this
conservatism in terminology. The names of the three
parts of the Encyclopaedia are, we may say, non-significant
<pb n='xiv'/><anchor id='Pgxiv'/>
of their peculiar contents. And that for
a good reason. What Hegel proposes to give is no
novel or special doctrine, but the universal philosophy
which has passed on from age to age, here narrowed
and there widened, but still essentially the same. It
is conscious of its continuity and proud of its identity
with the teachings of Plato and Aristotle.
</p>

<p>
The earliest attempts of the Greek philosophers to
present philosophy in a complete and articulated order&mdash;attempts
generally attributed to the Stoics, the schoolmen
of antiquity&mdash;made it a tripartite whole. These
three parts were Logic, Physics, and Ethics. In their
entirety they were meant to form a cycle of unified
knowledge, satisfying the needs of theory as well as
practice. As time went on, however, the situation
changed: and if the old names remained, their scope
and value suffered many changes. New interests and
curiosities, due to altered circumstances, brought other
departments of reality under the focus of investigation
besides those which had been primarily discussed under
the old names. Inquiries became more specialised,
and each tended to segregate itself from the rest as an
independent field of science. The result was that in
modern times the territory still marked by the ancient
titles had shrunk to a mere phantom of its former bulk.
Almost indeed things had come to such a pass that the
time-honoured figures had sunk into the misery of <foreign rend='italic'>rois
fainéants</foreign>; while the real business of knowledge was
discharged by the younger and less conventional lines
of research which the needs and fashions of the time
had called up. Thus Logic, in the narrow formal sense,
was turned into an <q>art</q> of argumentation and a system
of technical rules for the analysis and synthesis of
academical discussion. Physics or Natural Philosophy
restricted itself to the elaboration of some metaphysical
<pb n='xv'/><anchor id='Pgxv'/>
postulates or hypotheses regarding the general modes
of physical operation. And Ethics came to be a very
unpractical discussion of subtleties regarding moral
faculty and moral standard. Meanwhile a theory of
scientific method and of the laws governing the growth
of intelligence and formation of ideas grew up, and left
the older logic to perish of formality and inanition.
The successive departments of physical science, each
in turn asserting its independence, finally left Natural
Philosophy no alternative between clinging to its outworn
hypotheses and abstract generalities, or identifying
itself (as Newton in his great book put it) with the
<hi rend='italic'>Principia Mathematica</hi> of the physical sciences. Ethics,
in its turn, saw itself, on one hand, replaced by psychological
inquiries into the relations between the feelings
and the will and the intelligence; while, on the other
hand, a host of social, historical, economical, and other
researches cut it off from the real facts of human life,
and left it no more than the endless debates on the
logical and metaphysical issues involved in free-will
and conscience, duty and merit.
</p>

<p>
It has sometimes been said that Kant settled this
controversy between the old departments of philosophy
and the new branches of science. And the settlement,
it is implied, consisted in assigning to the philosopher
a sort of police and patrol duty in the commonwealth
of science. He was to see that boundaries were duly
respected, and that each science kept strictly to its own
business. For this purpose each branch of philosophy
was bound to convert itself into a department of criticism&mdash;an
examination of first principles in the several
provinces of reality or experience&mdash;with a view to get
a distinct conception of what they were, and thus define
exactly the lines on which the structures of more
detailed science could be put up solidly and safely.
<pb n='xvi'/><anchor id='Pgxvi'/>
This plan offered tempting lines to research, and sounded
well. But on further reflection there emerge one or
two difficulties, hard to get over. Paradoxical though
it may seem, one cannot rightly estimate the capacity
and range of foundations, before one has had some
familiarity with the buildings erected upon them. Thus
you are involved in a circle: a circle which is probably
inevitable, but which for that reason it is well to recognise
at once. Then&mdash;what is only another way of saying
the same thing&mdash;it is impossible to draw an inflexible
line between premises of principle and conclusions of
detail. There is no spot at which criticism can stop,
and, having done its business well, hand on the remaining
task to dogmatic system. It was an instinctive
feeling of this implication of system in what professed
only to be criticism which led the aged Kant to
ignore his own previous professions that he offered as
yet no system, and when Fichte maintained himself to
be erecting the fabric for which Kant had prepared the
ground, to reply by the counter-declaration that the
criticism was the system&mdash;that <q>the curtain was the
picture.</q>
</p>

<p>
The Hegelian philosophy is an attempt to combine
criticism with system, and thus realise what Kant had
at least foretold. It is a system which is self-critical,
and systematic only through the absoluteness of its
criticism. In Hegel's own phrase, it is an immanent
and an incessant dialectic, which from first to last allows
finality to no dogmatic rest, but carries out Kant's
description of an Age of Criticism, in which nothing,
however majestic and sacred its authority, can plead
for exception from the all-testing <foreign rend='italic'>Elenchus</foreign>. Then, on
the other hand, Hegel refuses to restrict philosophy
and its branches to anything short of the totality. He
takes in its full sense that often-used phrase&mdash;the Unity
<pb n='xvii'/><anchor id='Pgxvii'/>
of Knowledge. Logic becomes the all-embracing
research of <q>first principles,</q>&mdash;the principles which
regulate physics and ethics. The old divisions between
logic and metaphysic, between induction and deduction,
between theory of reasoning and theory of knowledge,&mdash;divisions
which those who most employed them were
never able to show the reason and purpose of&mdash;because
indeed they had grown up at various times and by
<q>natural selection</q> through a vast mass of incidents:
these are superseded and merged in one continuous
theory of real knowledge considered under its abstract
or formal aspect,&mdash;of organised and known reality in
its underlying thought-system. But these first principles
were only an abstraction from complete reality&mdash;the
reality which nature has when unified by mind&mdash;and
they presuppose the total from which they are derived.
The realm of pure thought is only the ghost of the
Idea&mdash;of the unity and reality of knowledge, and it
must be reindued with its flesh and blood. The logical
world is (in Kantian phrase) only the <emph>possibility</emph> of
Nature and Mind. It comes first&mdash;because it is a system
of First Principles: but these first principles could
only be elicited by a philosophy which has realised the
meaning of a mental experience, gathered by interpreting
the facts of Nature.
</p>

<p>
Natural Philosophy is no longer&mdash;according to Hegel's
view of it&mdash;merely a scheme of mathematical ground-work.
That may be its first step. But its scope is
a complete unity (which is not a mere aggregate) of the
branches of natural knowledge, exploring both the
inorganic and the organic world. In dealing with this
endless problem, philosophy seems to be baulked by an
impregnable obstacle to its progress. Every day the
advance of specialisation renders any comprehensive or
synoptic view of the totality of science more and more
<pb n='xviii'/><anchor id='Pgxviii'/>
impossible. No doubt we talk readily enough of Science.
But here, if anywhere, we may say there is no Science,
but only sciences. The generality of science is a proud
fiction or a gorgeous dream, variously told and interpreted
according to the varying interest and proclivity
of the scientist. The sciences, or those who specially
expound them, know of no unity, no philosophy of
science. They are content to remark that in these
days the thing is impossible, and to pick out the faults
in any attempts in that direction that are made outside
their pale. Unfortunately for this contention, the thing
is done by us all, and, indeed, has to be done. If not
as men of science, yet as men&mdash;as human beings&mdash;we
have to put together things and form some total estimate
of the drift of development, of the unity of nature. To
get a notion, not merely of the general methods and
principles of the sciences, but of their results and
teachings, and to get this not as a mere lot of fragments,
but with a systematic unity, is indispensable in some
degree for all rational life. The life not founded on
science is not the life of man. But he will not find
what he wants in the text-books of the specialist, who
is obliged to treat his subject, as Plato says, <q>under
the pressure of necessity,</q> and who dare not look on it
in its quality <q>to draw the soul towards truth, and to
form the philosophic intellect so as to uplift what we
now unduly keep down<note place='foot'>Plato, <hi rend='italic'>Rep.</hi> 527.</note>.</q> If the philosopher in this
province does his work but badly, he may plead the
novelty of the task to which he comes as a pioneer or
even an architect. He finds little that he can directly
utilise. The materials have been gathered and prepared
for very special aims; and the great aim of science&mdash;that
human life may be made a higher, an ampler, and
<pb n='xix'/><anchor id='Pgxix'/>
happier thing,&mdash;has hardly been kept in view at all,
except in its more materialistic aspects. To the philosopher
the supreme interest of the physical sciences is
that man also belongs to the physical universe, or that
Mind and Matter as we know them are (in Mr. Spencer's
language) <q>at once antithetical and inseparable.</q> He
wants to find the place of Man,&mdash;but of Man as Mind&mdash;in
Nature.
</p>

<p>
If the scope of Natural Philosophy be thus expanded
to make it the unity and more than the synthetic aggregate
of the several physical sciences&mdash;to make it the
whole which surpasses the addition of all their fragments,
the purpose of Ethics has not less to be deepened
and widened. Ethics, under that title, Hegel knows
not. And for those who cannot recognise anything
unless it be clearly labelled, it comes natural to record
their censure of Hegelianism for ignoring or disparaging
ethical studies. But if we take the word in that wide
sense which common usage rather justifies than adopts,
we may say that the whole philosophy of Mind is
a moral philosophy. Its subject is the moral as opposed
to the physical aspect of reality: the inner and ideal
life as opposed to the merely external and real materials
of it: the world of intelligence and of humanity. It
displays Man in the several stages of that process by
which he expresses the full meaning of nature, or discharges
the burden of that task which is implicit in him
from the first. It traces the steps of that growth by
which what was no better than a fragment of nature&mdash;an
intelligence located (as it seemed) in one piece of
matter&mdash;comes to realise the truth of it and of himself.
That truth is his ideal and his obligation: but it is also&mdash;such
is the mystery of his birthright&mdash;his idea and
possession. He&mdash;like the natural universe&mdash;is (as the
<hi rend='italic'>Logic</hi> has shown) a principle of unification, organisation,
<pb n='xx'/><anchor id='Pgxx'/>
idealisation: and his history (in its ideal completeness)
is the history of the process by which he, the typical
man, works the fragments of reality (and such mere
reality must be always a collection of fragments) into
the perfect unity of a many-sided character. Thus the
philosophy of mind, beginning with man as a sentient
organism, the focus in which the universe gets its first
dim confused expression through mere feeling, shows
how he <q>erects himself above himself</q> and realises
what ancient thinkers called his kindred with the divine.
</p>

<p>
In that total process of the mind's liberation and
self-realisation the portion specially called Morals is
but one, though a necessary, stage. There are, said
Porphyry and the later Platonists, four degrees in the
path of perfection and self-accomplishment. And first,
there is the career of honesty and worldly prudence,
which makes the duty of the citizen. Secondly, there
is the progress in purity which casts earthly things
behind, and reaches the angelic height of passionless
serenity. And the third step is the divine life which
by intellectual energy is turned to behold the truth of
things. Lastly, in the fourth grade, the mind, free
and sublime in self-sustaining wisdom, makes itself an
<q>exemplar</q> of virtue, and is even a <q>father of Gods.</q>
Even so, it may be said, the human mind is the subject
of a complicated Teleology,&mdash;the field ruled by a multifarious
Ought, psychological, aesthetical, social and
religious. To adjust their several claims cannot be the
object of any science, if adjustment means to supply
a guide in practice. But it is the purpose of such
a teleology to show that social requirements and moral
duty as ordinarily conceived do not exhaust the range
of obligation,&mdash;of the supreme ethical Ought. How
that can best be done is however a question of some
difficulty. For the ends under examination do not
<pb n='xxi'/><anchor id='Pgxxi'/>
fall completely into a serial order, nor does one involve
others in such a way as to destroy their independence.
You cannot absolve psychology as if it stood independent
of ethics or religion, nor can aesthetic considerations
merely supervene on moral. Still, it may
be said, the order followed by Hegel seems on the
whole liable to fewer objections than others.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Herbert Spencer, the only English philosopher
who has even attempted a <emph>System</emph> of Philosophy, may in
this point be compared with Hegel. He also begins with
a <hi rend='italic'>First Principles</hi>,&mdash;a work which, like Hegel's <hi rend='italic'>Logic</hi>,
starts by presenting Philosophy as the supreme arbiter
between the subordinate principles of Religion and
Science, which are in it <q>necessary correlatives.</q> The
positive task of philosophy is (with some inconsistency
or vagueness) presented, in the next place, as a <q>unification
of knowledge.</q> Such a unification has to make
explicit the implicit unity of known reality: because
<q>every thought involves a whole system of thoughts.</q>
And such a programme might again suggest the Logic.
But unfortunately Mr. Spencer does not (and he has
Francis Bacon to justify him here) think it worth his
while to toil up the weary, but necessary, mount of
Purgatory which is known to us as Logic. With
a naïve realism, he builds on Cause and Power, and
above all on Force, that <q>Ultimate of Ultimates,</q> which
seems to be, however marvellously, a denizen both of the
Known and the Unknowable world. In the known world
this Ultimate appears under two forms, matter and
motion, and the problem of science and philosophy is
to lay down in detail and in general the law of their
continuous redistribution, of the segregation of motion
from matter, and the inclusion of motion into matter.
</p>

<p>
Of this process, which has no beginning and no end,&mdash;the
rhythm of generation and corruption, attraction
<pb n='xxii'/><anchor id='Pgxxii'/>
and repulsion, it may be said that it is properly not
a first principle of all knowledge, but the general or
fundamental portion of Natural Philosophy to which
Mr. Spencer next proceeds. Such a philosophy,
however, he gives only in part: viz. as a Biology, dealing
with organic (and at a further stage and under other
names, with supra-organic) life. And that the Philosophy
of Nature should take this form, and carry both the
First Principles and the later portions of the system
with it, as parts of a philosophy of evolution, is what
we should have expected from the contemporaneous
interests of science<note place='foot'>The prospectus of the <hi rend='italic'>System of Synthetic Philosophy</hi> is dated
1860. Darwin's <hi rend='italic'>Origin of Species</hi> is 1859. But such ideas, both in
Mr. Spencer and others, are earlier than Darwin's book.</note>. Even a one-sided attempt to give
speculative unity to those researches, which get&mdash;for
reasons the scientific specialist seldom asks&mdash;the title of
biological, is however worth noting as a recognition of
the necessity of a <foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Natur-philosophie</foreign>,&mdash;a speculative
science of Nature.
</p>

<p>
The third part of the Hegelian System corresponds
to what in the <hi rend='italic'>Synthetic Philosophy</hi> is known as Psychology,
Ethics, and Sociology. And here Mr. Spencer
recognises that something new has turned up. Psychology
is <q>unique</q> as a science: it is a <q>double science,</q>
and as a whole quite <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>sui generis</foreign>. Whether perhaps all
these epithets would not, <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>mutatis mutandis</foreign>, have to be
applied also to Ethics and Sociology, if these are to do
their full work, he does not say. In what this doubleness
consists he even finds it somewhat difficult to show.
For, as his fundamental philosophy does not on this
point go beyond noting some pairs of verbal antitheses,
and has no sense of unity except in the imperfect shape
of a <q>relation<note place='foot'>Hegel's <foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Verhältniss</foreign>, the supreme category of what is called
actuality: where object is necessitated by outside object.</note></q> between two things which are <q>antithetical
<pb n='xxiii'/><anchor id='Pgxxiii'/>
and inseparable,</q> he is perplexed by phrases
such as <q>in</q> and <q>out of</q> consciousness, and stumbles
over the equivocal use of <q>inner</q> to denote both mental
(or non-spatial) in general, and locally sub-cuticular in
special. Still, he gets so far as to see that the law of
consciousness is that in it neither feelings nor relations
have independent subsistence, and that the unit of mind
does not begin till what he calls two feelings are made
one. The phraseology may be faulty, but it shows an
inkling of the <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>a priori</foreign>. Unfortunately it is apparently
forgotten; and the language too often reverts into the
habit of what he calls the <q>objective,</q> i.e. purely
physical, sciences.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Spencer's conception of Psychology restricts it to
the more general physics of the mind. For its more concrete
life he refers us to Sociology. But his Sociology
is yet unfinished: and from the plan of its inception,
and the imperfect conception of the ends and means of
its investigation, hardly admits of completion in any
systematic sense. To that incipiency is no doubt due
its excess in historical or anecdotal detail&mdash;detail, however,
too much segregated from its social context, and
in general its tendency to neglect normal and central
theory for incidental and peripheral facts. Here, too,
there is a weakness in First Principles and a love of
catchwords, which goes along with the fallacy that
illustration is proof. Above all, it is evident that the
great fact of religion overhangs Mr. Spencer with the
attraction of an unsolved and unacceptable problem.
He cannot get the religious ideas of men into co-ordination
with their scientific, aesthetic, and moral doctrines;
and only betrays his sense of the high importance of the
former by placing them in the forefront of inquiry, as
due to the inexperience and limitations of the so-called
primitive man. That is hardly adequate recognition of
<pb n='xxiv'/><anchor id='Pgxxiv'/>
the religious principle: and the defect will make itself
seriously felt, should he ever come to carry out the
further stage of his prospectus dealing with <q>the growth
and correlation of language, knowledge, morals, and
aesthetics.</q>

<p>
A Mental Philosophy&mdash;if we so put what might also
be rendered a Spiritual Philosophy, or Philosophy of
Spirit&mdash;may to an English reader suggest something
much narrower than it actually contains. A Philosophy
of the Human Mind&mdash;if we consult English specimens&mdash;would
not imply much more than a psychology, and
probably what is called an inductive psychology. But
as Hegel understands it, it covers an unexpectedly wide
range of topics, the whole range from Nature to Spirit.
Besides Subjective Mind, which would seem on first
thoughts to exhaust the topics of psychology, it goes on
to Mind as Objective, and finally to Absolute mind.
And such combinations of words may sound either self-contradictory
or meaningless.
</p>

<p>
The first Section deals with the range of what is
usually termed Psychology. That term indeed is employed
by Hegel, in a restricted sense, to denote the
last of the three sub-sections in the discussion of Subjective
Mind. The Mind, which is the topic of psychology
proper, cannot be assumed as a ready-made object,
or datum. A Self, a self-consciousness, an intelligent
and volitional agent, if it be the birthright of man, is
a birthright which he has to realise for himself, to earn
and to make his own. To trace the steps by which
<pb n='xxv'/><anchor id='Pgxxv'/>
mind in its stricter acceptation, as will and intelligence,
emerges from the general animal sensibility which is
the crowning phase of organic life, and the final problem
of biology, is the work of two preliminary sub-sections&mdash;the
first entitled <hi rend='italic'>Anthropology</hi>, the second
the <hi rend='italic'>Phenomenology of Mind</hi>.
</p>

<p>
The subject of Anthropology, as Hegel understands
it, is the Soul&mdash;the raw material of consciousness, the
basis of all higher mental life. This is a borderland,
where the ground is still debateable between Nature
and Mind: it is the region of feeling, where the sensibility
has not yet been differentiated to intelligence.
Soul and body are here, as the phrase goes, in communion:
the inward life is still imperfectly disengaged
from its natural co-physical setting. Still one with
nature, it submits to natural influences and natural
vicissitudes: is not as yet master of itself, but the half-passive
receptacle of a foreign life, of a general vitality,
of a common soul not yet fully differentiated into individuality.
But it is awaking to self-activity: it is
emerging to Consciousness,&mdash;to distinguish itself, as
aware and conscious, from the facts of life and sentiency
of which it is aware.
</p>

<p>
From this region of psychical physiology or physiological
psychology, Hegel in the second sub-section of
his first part takes us to the <q>Phenomenology of Mind,</q>&mdash;to
Consciousness. The sentient soul is also conscious&mdash;but
in a looser sense of that word<note place='foot'>Cf. Herbart, <hi rend='italic'>Werke</hi> (ed. Kehrbach), iv. 372. This consciousness
proper is what Leibniz called <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'><q>Apperception,</q> la connaissance réflexive
de l'état intérieur (Nouveaux Essais)</foreign>.</note>: it has feelings,
but can scarcely be said <emph>itself</emph> to know that it has them.
As consciousness, the Soul has come to separate what
it is from what it feels. The distinction emerges of
a subject which is conscious, and an object <emph>of</emph> which it
<pb n='xxvi'/><anchor id='Pgxxvi'/>
is conscious. And the main thing is obviously the
relationship between the two, or the Consciousness
itself, as tending to distinguish itself alike from its subject
and its object. Hence, perhaps, may be gathered
why it is called Phenomenology of Mind. Mind as yet
is not yet more than emergent or apparent: nor yet
self-possessed and self-certified. No longer, however,
one with the circumambient nature which it feels, it sees
itself set against it, but only as a passive recipient of it,
a <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>tabula rasa</foreign> on which external nature is reflected, or
to which phenomena are presented. No longer, on the
other hand, a mere passive instrument of suggestion
from without, its instinct of life, its <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>nisus</foreign> of self-assertion
is developed, through antagonism to a like <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>nisus</foreign>,
into the consciousness of self-hood, of a Me and Mine
as set against a Thee and Thine. But just in proportion
as it is so developed in opposition to and recognition
of other equally self-centred selves, it has passed beyond
the narrower characteristic of Consciousness proper.
It is no longer mere intelligent perception or reproduction
of a world, but it is life, with perception (or apperception)
of that life. It has returned in a way to its
original unity with nature, but it is now the sense of its
self-hood&mdash;the consciousness of itself as the focus in
which subjective and objective are at one. Or, to put
it in the language of the great champion of Realism<note place='foot'>Herbart, <hi rend='italic'>Werke</hi>, vi. 55 (ed. Kehrbach).</note>,
the standpoint of Reason or full-grown Mind is this:
<q>The world which appears to us is our percept, therefore
in us. The real world, out of which we explain the
phenomenon, is our thought: therefore in us.</q>
</p>

<p>
The third sub-section of the theory of Subjective
Mind&mdash;the Psychology proper&mdash;deals with Mind. This
is the real, independent Psyché&mdash;hence the special
<pb n='xxvii'/><anchor id='Pgxxvii'/>
appropriation of the term Psychology. <q>The Soul,</q>
says Herbart, <q>no doubt dwells in a body: there are,
moreover, corresponding states of the one and the other:
but nothing corporeal occurs in the Soul, nothing purely
mental, which we could reckon to our Ego, occurs in
the body: the affections of the body are no representations
of the Ego, and our pleasant and unpleasant
feelings do not immediately lie in the organic life they
favour or hinder.</q> Such a Soul, so conceived, is an
intelligent and volitional self, a being of intellectual and
<q>active</q> powers or phenomena: it is a Mind. And
<q>Mind,</q> adds Hegel<note place='foot'>p. <ref target='Pg059'>59</ref> (§ 440).</note>, <q>is just this elevation above
Nature and physical modes and above the complication
with an external object.</q> Nothing is <emph>external</emph> to
it: it is rather the internalising of all externality. In
this psychology proper, we are out of any immediate
connexion with physiology. <q>Psychology as such,</q>
remarks Herbart, <q>has its questions common to it with
Idealism</q>&mdash;with the doctrine that all reality is mental
reality. It traces, in Hegel's exposition of it, the steps
of the way by which mind realises that independence
which is its characteristic stand-point. On the intellectual
side that independence is assured in language,&mdash;the
system of signs by which the intelligence stamps external
objects as its own, made part of its inner world. A
science, some one has said, is after all only <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>une langue
bien faite</foreign>. So, reversing the saying, we may note that
a language is an inwardised and mind-appropriated
world. On the active side, the independence of mind
is seen in self-enjoyment, in happiness, or self-content,
where impulse and volition have attained satisfaction in
equilibrium, and the soul possesses itself in fullness.
Such a mind<note place='foot'>p. <ref target='Pg063'>63</ref> (§ 440).</note>, which has made the world its certified
<pb n='xxviii'/><anchor id='Pgxxviii'/>
possession in language, and which enjoys itself in self-possession
of soul, called happiness, is a free Mind.
And that is the highest which Subjective Mind can reach.
</p>

<p>
At this point, perhaps, having rounded off by a
liberal sweep the scope of psychology, the ordinary
mental philosophy would stop. Hegel, instead of
finishing, now goes on to the field of what he calls
Objective Mind. For as yet it has been only the story
of a preparation, an inward adorning and equipment,
and we have yet to see what is to come of it in actuality.
Or rather, we have yet to consider the social forms on
which this preparation rests. The mind, self-possessed
and sure of itself or free, is so only through the objective
shape which its main development runs parallel
with. An intelligent Will, or a practical reason, was
the last word of the psychological development. But
a reason which is practical, or a volition which is
intelligent, is realised by action which takes regular
shapes, and by practice which transforms the world.
The theory of Objective Mind delineates the new form
which nature assumes under the sway of intelligence and
will. That intellectual world realises itself by transforming
the physical into a social and political world, the
given natural conditions of existence into a freely-instituted
system of life, the primitive struggle of kinds
for subsistence into the ordinances of the social state.
Given man as a being possessed of will and intelligence,
this inward faculty, whatever be its degree, will try to
impress itself on nature and to reproduce itself in a
legal, a moral, and social world. The kingdom of deed
replaces, or rises on the foundation of, the kingdom of
word: and instead of the equilibrium of a well-adjusted
soul comes the harmonious life of a social organism.
We are, in short, in the sphere of Ethics and Politics,
of Jurisprudence and Morals, of Law and Conscience.
</p>

<pb n='xxix'/><anchor id='Pgxxix'/>

<p>
Here,&mdash;as always in Hegel's system&mdash;there is a triad
of steps. First the province of Law or Right. But if
we call it Law, we must keep out of sight the idea of
a special law-giver, of a conscious imposition of laws,
above all by a political superior. And if we call it
Right, we must remember that it is neutral, inhuman,
abstract right: the right whose principle is impartial
and impassive uniformity, equality, order;&mdash;not moral
right, or the equity which takes cognisance of circumstances,
of personal claims, and provides against its own
hardness. The intelligent will of Man, throwing itself
upon the mere gifts of nature as their appointed master,
creates the world of Property&mdash;of things instrumental,
and regarded as adjectival, to the human personality.
But the autonomy of Reason (which is latent in the will)
carries with it certain consequences. As it acts, it also,
by its inherent quality of uniformity or universality,
enacts for itself a law and laws, and creates the realm
of formal equality or order-giving law. But this is
a <emph>mere</emph> equality: which is not inconsistent with what in
other respects may be excess of inequality. What one
does, if it is really to be treated as done, others may or
even must do: each act creates an expectation of continuance
and uniformity of behaviour. The doer is
bound by it, and others are entitled to do the like. The
material which the person appropriates creates a system
of obligation. Thus is constituted&mdash;in the natural give
and take of rational Wills&mdash;in the inevitable course of
human action and reaction,&mdash;a system of rights and duties.
This law of equality&mdash;the basis of justice, and the seed
of benevolence&mdash;is the scaffolding or perhaps rather the
rudimentary framework of society and moral life. Or
it is the bare skeleton which is to be clothed upon by
the softer and fuller outlines of the social tissues and
the ethical organs.
</p>

<pb n='xxx'/><anchor id='Pgxxx'/>

<p>
And thus the first range of Objective Mind postulates
the second, which Hegel calls <q>Morality.</q> The word is
to be taken in its strict sense as a protest against the
quasi-physical order of law. It is the morality of conscience
and of the good will, of the inner rectitude of
soul and purpose, as all-sufficient and supreme. Here
is brought out the complementary factor in social life:
the element of liberty, spontaneity, self-consciousness.
The motto of mere inward morality (as opposed to the
spirit of legality) is (in Kant's words): <q>There is nothing
without qualification good, in heaven or earth, but only
a good will.</q> The essential condition of goodness is
that the action be done with purpose and intelligence,
and in full persuasion of its goodness by the conscience
of the agent. The characteristic of Morality thus
described is its essential inwardness, and the sovereignty
of the conscience over all heteronomy. Its justification
is that it protests against the authority of a mere
external or objective order, subsisting and ruling in
separation from the subjectivity. Its defect is the turn
it gives to this assertion of the rights of subjective conscience:
briefly in the circumstance that it tends to set
up a mere individualism against a mere universalism,
instead of realising the unity and essential interdependence
of the two.
</p>

<p>
The third sub-section of the theory of Objective
Mind describes a state of affairs in which this antithesis
is explicitly overcome. This is the moral life
in a social community. Here law and usage prevail
and provide the fixed permanent scheme of life: but
the law and the usage are, in their true or ideal conception,
only the unforced expression of the mind and
will of those who live under them. And, on the other
hand, the mind and will of the individual members of
such a community are pervaded and animated by its
<pb n='xxxi'/><anchor id='Pgxxxi'/>
universal spirit. In such a community, and so constituting
it, the individual is at once free and equal, and
that because of the spirit of fraternity, which forms its
spiritual link. In the world supposed to be governed
by mere legality the idea of right is exclusively prominent;
and when that is the case, it may often happen
that <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>summum jus summa injuria</foreign>. In mere morality,
the stress falls exclusively on the idea of inward freedom,
or the necessity of the harmony of the judgment and
the will, or the dependence of conduct upon conscience.
In the union of the two, in the moral community
as normally constituted, the mere idea of right is replaced,
or controlled and modified, by the idea of equity&mdash;a
balance as it were between the two preceding,
inasmuch as motive and purpose are employed to
modify and interpret strict right. But this effect&mdash;this
harmonisation&mdash;is brought about by the predominance
of a new idea&mdash;the principle of benevolence,&mdash;a
principle however which is itself modified by the
fundamental idea of right or law<note place='foot'>These remarks refer to four out of the five Herbartian ethical
ideas. See also Leibniz, who (in 1693, <hi rend='italic'>De Notionibus juris et justitiae</hi>)
had given the following definitions: <q>Caritas est benevolentia universalis.
Justitia est caritas sapientis. Sapientia est scientia felicitatis.</q>
The jus naturae has three grades: the lowest, jus strictum; the
second, aequitas (or caritas, in the narrower sense); and the highest,
pietas, which is honeste, i.e. pie vivere.</note> into a wise or
regulated kindliness.
</p>

<p>
But what Hegel chiefly deals with under this head is
the interdependence of form and content, of social order
and personal progress. In the picture of an ethical
organisation or harmoniously-alive moral community he
shows us partly the underlying idea which gave room for
the antithesis between law and conscience, and partly
the outlines of the ideal in which that conflict becomes
only the instrument of progress. This organisation
<pb n='xxxii'/><anchor id='Pgxxxii'/>
has three grades or three typical aspects. These are
the Family, Civil Society, and the State. The first of
these, the Family, must be taken to include those
primary unities of human life where the natural affinity
of sex and the natural ties of parentage are the preponderant
influence in forming and maintaining the
social group. This, as it were, is the soul-nucleus of
social organisation: where the principle of unity is an
instinct, a feeling, an absorbing solidarity. Next comes
what Hegel has called Civil Society,&mdash;meaning however
by civil the antithesis to political, the society of those
who may be styled <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>bourgeois</foreign>, not <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>citoyens</foreign>:&mdash;and meaning
by society the antithesis to community. There are
other natural influences binding men together besides
those which form the close unities of the family, gens,
tribe, or clan. Economical needs associate human
beings within a much larger radius&mdash;in ways capable of
almost indefinite expansion&mdash;but also in a way much
less intense and deep. Civil Society is the more or
less loosely organised aggregate of such associations,
which, if, on one hand, they keep human life from
stagnating in the mere family, on another, accentuate
more sharply the tendency to competition and the
struggle for life. Lastly, in the Political State comes
the synthesis of family and society. Of the family; in
so far as the State tends to develope itself on the
nature-given unit of the Nation (an extended family,
supplementing as need arises real descent by fictitious
incorporations), and has apparently never permanently
maintained itself except on the basis of a predominant
common nationality. Of society; in so far as the
extension and dispersion of family ties have left free
room for the differentiation of many other sides of
human interest and action, and given ground for the
full development of individuality. In consequence of
<pb n='xxxiii'/><anchor id='Pgxxxiii'/>
this, the State (and such a state as Hegel describes is
essentially the idea or ideal of the modern State)<note place='foot'>To which the Greek πόλις, the Latin civitas or respublica, were
only approximations. Hegel <emph>is not writing a history</emph>. If he were, it
would be necessary for him to point out how far the individual
instance, e.g. Rome, or Prussia, corresponded to its Idea.</note> has
a certain artificial air about it. It can only be maintained
by the free action of intelligence: it must
make its laws public: it must bring to consciousness
the principles of its constitution, and create agencies
for keeping up unity of organisation through the several
separate provinces or contending social interests, each
of which is inclined to insist on the right of home
mis-rule.
</p>

<p>
The State&mdash;which in its actuality must always be
a quasi-national state&mdash;is thus the supreme unity of
Nature and Mind. Its natural basis in land, language,
blood, and the many ties which spring therefrom, has
to be constantly raised into an intelligent unity through
universal interests. But the elements of race and of
culture have no essential connexion, and they perpetually
incline to wrench themselves asunder. Blood
and judgment are for ever at war in the state as in the
individual<note place='foot'>Shakespeare's phrase, as in <hi rend='italic'>Othello</hi>, iii. 2; <hi rend='italic'>Lover's Complaint</hi>,
v. 24.</note>: the cosmopolitan interest, to which the
maxim is <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>Ubi bene, ibi patria</foreign>, resists the national, which
adopts the patriotic watchword of Hector<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Iliad</hi>, xii. 243.</note>. The State
however has another source of danger in the very
principle that gave it birth. It arose through antagonism:
it was baptised on the battlefield, and it only
lives as it is able to assert itself against a foreign foe.
And this circumstance tends to intensify and even
pervert its natural basis of nationality:&mdash;tends to give
the very conception of the political a negative and
<pb n='xxxiv'/><anchor id='Pgxxxiv'/>
superficial look. But, notwithstanding all these drawbacks,
the State in its Idea is entitled to the name
Hobbes gave it,&mdash;the Mortal God. Here in a way
culminates the obviously objective,&mdash;we may almost
say, visible and tangible&mdash;development of Man and
Mind. Here it attains a certain completeness&mdash;a union
of reality and of ideality: a quasi-immortality, a quasi-universality.
What the individual person could not do
unaided, he can do in the strength of his commonwealth.
Much that in the solitary was but implicit or potential,
is in the State actualised.
</p>

<p>
But the God of the State is a mortal God. It is but
a national and a limited mind. To be actual, one must
at least begin by restricting oneself. Or, rather actuality
is rational, but always with a conditioned and a relative
rationality<note place='foot'>See Hegel's <hi rend='italic'>Logic</hi>, pp. 257 seq.</note>: it is in the realm of action and re-action,&mdash;in
the realm of change and nature. It has warring
forces outside it,&mdash;warring forces inside it. Its unity
is never perfect: because it never produces a true
identity of interests within, or maintains an absolute
independence without. Thus the true and real State&mdash;the
State in its Idea&mdash;the realisation of concrete
humanity,&mdash;of Mind as the fullness and unity of nature&mdash;is
not reached in any single or historical State: but
floats away, when we try to seize it, into the endless
progress of history. Always indeed the State, the historical
and objective, points beyond itself. It does so
first in the succession of times. <foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Die Weltgeschichte ist
das Weltgericht.</foreign><note place='foot'>See p. <ref target='Pg153'>153</ref> (§ 550).</note> And in that doom of the world the
eternal blast sweeps along the successive generations of
the temporal, one expelling another from the stage
of time&mdash;each because it is inadequate to the Idea
which it tried to express, and has succumbed to an
<pb n='xxxv'/><anchor id='Pgxxxv'/>
enemy from without because it was not a real and true
unity within.
</p>

<p>
But if temporal flees away before another temporal,
it abides in so far as it has, however inadequately,
given expression and visible reality&mdash;as it points inward
and upward&mdash;to the eternal. The earthly state is
also the city of God; and if the republic of Plato seems
to find scant admission into the reality of flesh and
blood, it stands eternal as a witness in the heaven of
idea. Behind the fleeting succession of consulates and
dictatures, of aristocracy and empire, feuds of plebeian
with patrician, in that apparent anarchy of powers
which the so-called Roman constitution is to the superficial
observer, there is the eternal Rome, one, strong,
victorious, <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>semper eadem</foreign>: the Rome of Virgil and
Justinian, the ghost whereof still haunts with memories
the seven-hilled city, but which with full spiritual presence
lives in the law, the literature, the manners of
the modern world. To find fitter expression for this
Absolute Mind than it has in the Ethical community&mdash;to
reach that reality of which the moral world is but
one-sidedly representative&mdash;is the work of Art, Religion,
and Philosophy. And to deal with these efforts to find
the truth and the unity of Mind and Nature is the
subject of Hegel's third Section.
</p>

</div>

<div>
<head>(iii.) Religion and Philosophy.</head>

<p>
It may be well at this point to guard against a misconception
of this serial order of exposition<note place='foot'>Cf. <hi rend='italic'>Prolegomena to the Study of Hegel</hi>, chaps. xviii, xxvi.</note>. As stage
is seen to follow stage, the historical imagination, which
<pb n='xxxvi'/><anchor id='Pgxxxvi'/>
governs our ordinary current of ideas, turns the logical
dependence into a time-sequence. But it is of course
not meant that the later stage follows the earlier in
history. The later is the more real, and therefore the
more fundamental. But we can only understand by
abstracting and then transcending our abstractions, or
rather by showing how the abstraction implies relations
which force us to go further and beyond our arbitrary
arrest. Each stage therefore either stands to that
preceding it as an antithesis, which inevitably dogs its
steps as an accusing spirit, or it is the conjunction of
the original thesis with the antithesis, in a union which
should not be called synthesis because it is a closer
fusion and true marriage of minds. A truth and reality,
though fundamental, is only appreciated at its true
value and seen in all its force where it appears as the
reconciliation and reunion of partial and opposing
points of view. Thus, e.g., the full significance of the
State does not emerge so long as we view it in isolation
as a supposed single state, but only as it is seen in the
conflict of history, in its actual <q>energy</q> as a world-power
among powers, always pointing beyond itself to a something
universal which it fain would be, and yet cannot
be. Or, again, there never was a civil or economic
society which existed save under the wing of a state, or
in one-sided assumption of state powers to itself: and
a family is no isolated and independent unit belonging
to a supposed patriarchal age, but was always mixed
up with, and in manifold dependence upon, political and
civil combinations. The true family, indeed, far from
preceding the state in time, presupposes the political
power to give it its precise sphere and its social
stability: as is well illustrated by that typical form of
it presented in the Roman state.
</p>

<p>
So, again, religion does not supervene upon an
<pb n='xxxvii'/><anchor id='Pgxxxvii'/>
already existing political and moral system and invest
it with an additional sanction. The true order would
be better described as the reverse. The real basis of
social life, and even of intelligence, is religion. As
some thinkers quaintly put it, the known rests and lives
on the bosom of the Unknowable. But when we say
that, we must at once guard against a misconception.
There are religions of all sorts; and some of them
which are most heard of in the modern world only
exist or survive in the shape of a traditional name and
venerated creed which has lost its power. Nor is
a religion necessarily committed to a definite conception
of a supernatural&mdash;of a personal power outside the
order of Nature. But in all cases, religion is a faith
and a theory which gives unity to the facts of life, and
gives it, not because the unity is in detail proved or
detected, but because life and experience in their
deepest reality inexorably demand and evince such
a unity to the heart. The religion of a time is not its
nominal creed, but its dominant conviction of the
meaning of reality, the principle which animates all
its being and all its striving, the faith it has in the
laws of nature and the purpose of life. Dimly or
clearly felt and perceived, religion has for its principle
(one cannot well say, its object) not the unknowable,
but the inner unity of life and knowledge, of act and
consciousness, a unity which is certified in its every
knowledge, but is never fully demonstrable by the
summation of all its ascertained items. As such a felt
and believed synthesis of the world and life, religion is
the unity which gives stability and harmony to the
social sphere; just as morality in its turn gives a
partial and practical realisation to the ideal of religion.
But religion does not merely establish and sanction
morality; it also frees it from a certain narrowness it
<pb n='xxxviii'/><anchor id='Pgxxxviii'/>
always has, as of the earth. Or, otherwise put, morality
has to the keener inspection something in it which is
more than the mere moral injunction at first indicates.
Beyond the moral, in its stricter sense, as the obligatory
duty and the obedience to law, rises and expands the
beautiful and the good: a beautiful which is disinterestedly
loved, and a goodness which has thrown
off all utilitarian relativity, and become a free self-enhancing
joy. The true spirit of religion sees in the
divine judgment not a mere final sanction to human
morality which has failed of its earthly close, not the
re-adjustment of social and political judgments in accordance
with our more conscientious inner standards,
but a certain, though, for our part-by-part vision,
incalculable proportion between what is done and
suffered. And in this liberation of the moral from
its restrictions, Art renders no slight aid. Thus in
different ways, religion presupposes morality to fill
up its vacant form, and morality presupposes religion
to give its laws an ultimate sanction, which at the same
time points beyond their limitations.
</p>

<p>
But art, religion, and philosophy still rest on the
national culture and on the individual mind. However
much they rise in the heights of the ideal world, they
never leave the reality of life and circumstance behind,
and float in the free empyrean. Yet there are degrees
of universality, degrees in which they reach what they
promised. As the various psychical <emph>nuclei</emph> of an individual
consciousness tend through the course of experience
to gather round a central idea and by fusion
and assimilation form a complete mental organisation;
so, through the march of history, there grows up a
complication and a fusion of national ideas and aspirations,
which, though still retaining the individuality and
restriction of a concrete national life, ultimately present
<pb n='xxxix'/><anchor id='Pgxxxix'/>
an organisation social, aesthetic, and religious which is
a type of humanity in its universality and completeness.
Always moving in the measure and on the lines of the
real development of its social organisation, the art and
religion of a nation tend to give expression to what
social and political actuality at its best but imperfectly
sets in existence. They come more and more to be, not
mere competing fragments as set side by side with
those of others, but comparatively equal and complete
representations of the many-sided and many-voiced
reality of man and the world. Yet always they live
and flourish in reciprocity with the fullness of practical
institutions and individual character. An abstractly
universal art and religion is a delusion&mdash;until all diversities
of geography and climate, of language and temperament,
have been made to disappear. If these
energies are in power and reality and not merely in
name, they cannot be applied like a panacea or put on
like a suit of ready-made clothes. If alive, they grow
with individualised type out of the social situation: and
they can only attain a vulgar and visible universality,
so far as they attach themselves to some simple and
uniform aspects,&mdash;a part tolerably identical everywhere&mdash;in
human nature in all times and races.
</p>

<p>
Art, according to Hegel's account, is the first of the
three expressions of Absolute Mind. But the key-note
to the whole is to be found in Religion<note place='foot'>As stated in p. 167 (<hi rend='italic'>Encycl.</hi> § 554). Cf. <hi rend='italic'>Phenom. d. Geistes</hi>, cap. vii,
which includes the Religion of Art, and the same point of view is
explicit in the first edition of the <hi rend='italic'>Encyclopaedia</hi>.</note>: or Religion
is the generic description of that phase of mind which
has found rest in the fullness of attainment and is no
longer a struggle and a warfare, but a fruition. <q>It is
the conviction of all nations,</q> he says<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Philosophie der Religion</hi> (<hi rend='italic'>Werke</hi>, xi. 5).</note>, <q>that in the
<pb n='xl'/><anchor id='Pgxl'/>
religious consciousness they hold their truth; and they
have always regarded religion as their dignity and as
the Sunday of their life. Whatever excites our doubts
and alarms, all grief and all anxiety, all that the petty
fields of finitude can offer to attract us, we leave behind
on the shoals of time: and as the traveller on the
highest peak of a mountain range, removed from every
distinct view of the earth's surface, quietly lets his vision
neglect all the restrictions of the landscape and the
world; so in this pure region of faith man, lifted above
the hard and inflexible reality, sees it with his mind's
eye reflected in the rays of the mental sun to an image
where its discords, its lights and shades, are softened
to eternal calm. In this region of mind flow the waters
of forgetfulness, from which Psyche drinks, and in
which she drowns all her pain: and the darknesses of
this life are here softened to a dream-image, and transfigured
into a mere setting for the splendours of the
Eternal.'</q>
</p>

<p>
If we take Religion, in this extended sense, we find
it is the sense, the vision, the faith, the certainty of the
eternal in the changeable, of the infinite in the finite, of
the reality in appearance, of the truth in error. It is
freedom from the distractions and pre-occupations of
the particular details of life; it is the sense of permanence,
repose, certainty, rounding off, toning down and
absorbing the vicissitude, the restlessness, the doubts
of actual life. Such a victory over palpable reality has
no doubt its origin&mdash;its embryology&mdash;in phases of
mind which have been already discussed in the first
section. Religion will vary enormously according to
the grade of national mood of mind and social development
in which it emerges. But whatever be the peculiarities
of its original swaddling-clothes, its cardinal
note will be a sense of dependence on, and independence
<pb n='xli'/><anchor id='Pgxli'/>
in, something more permanent, more august, more of
a surety and stay than visible and variable nature and
man,&mdash;something also which whether God or devil, or
both in one, holds the keys of life and death, of weal and
woe, and holds them from some safe vantage-ground
above the lower realms of change. By this central being
the outward and the inward, past and present and to
come, are made one. And as already indicated, Religion,
emerging, as it does, from social man, from mind ethical,
will retain traces of the two <foreign rend='italic'>foci</foreign> in society: the individual
subjectivity and the objective community. Retain
them however only as traces, which still show in the
actually envisaged reconciliation. For that is what
religion does to morality. It carries a step higher the
unity or rather combination gained in the State: it is
the fuller harmony of the individual and the collectivity.
The moral conscience rests in certainty and fixity on
the religious.
</p>

<p>
But Religion (thus widely understood as the faith in
sempiternal and all-explaining reality) at first appears
under a guise of Art. The poem and the pyramid, the
temple-image and the painting, the drama and the fairy
legend, these are religion: but they are, perhaps, religion
as Art. And that means that they present the eternal
under sensible representations, the work of an artist,
and in a perishable material of limited range. Yet even
the carvers of a long-past day whose works have been
disinterred from the plateaux of Auvergne knew that
they gave to the perishable life around them a quasi-immortality:
and the myth-teller of a savage tribe
elevated the incident of a season into a perennial power
of love and fear. The cynic may remind us that from
the finest picture of the artist, readily
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<lg>
<l rend='margin-left: 26'><q rend='pre'>We turn</q></l>
<l><q rend='post'>To yonder girl that fords the burn.</q></l>
</lg>
</quote>

<pb n='xlii'/><anchor id='Pgxlii'/>

<p>
And yet it may be said in reply to the cynic that, had it
not been for the deep-imprinted lesson of the artist, it
would have been but a brutal instinct that would have
drawn our eyes. The artist, the poet, the musician,
reveal the meaning, the truth, the reality of the world:
they teach us, they help us, backward younger brothers,
to see, to hear, to feel what our rude senses had failed
to detect. They enact the miracle of the loaves and
fishes, again and again: out of the common limited
things of every day they produce a bread of life in
which the generations continue to find nourishment.
</p>

<p>
But if Art embodies for us the unseen and the eternal,
it embodies it in the stone, the colour, the tone, and
the word: and these are by themselves only dead
matter. To the untutored eye and taste the finest
picture-gallery is only a weariness: when the national
life has drifted away, the sacred book and the image
are but idols and enigmas. <q>The statues are now
corpses from which the vivifying soul has fled, and the
hymns are words whence faith has departed: the tables
of the Gods are without spiritual meat and drink, and
games and feasts no longer afford the mind its joyful
union with the being of being. The works of the Muse
lack that intellectual force which knew itself strong and
real by crushing gods and men in its winepress. They
are now (in this iron age) what they are for us,&mdash;fair
fruits broken from the tree, and handed to us by a
kindly destiny. But the gift is like the fruits which
the girl in the picture presents: she does not give the
real life of their existence, not the tree which bore
them, not the earth and the elements which entered
into their substance, nor the climate which formed their
quality, nor the change of seasons which governed the
process of their growth. Like her, Destiny in giving
us the works of ancient art does not give us their world,
<pb n='xliii'/><anchor id='Pgxliii'/>
not the spring and summer of the ethical life in which
they blossomed and ripened, but solely a memory and
a suggestion of this actuality. Our act in enjoying
them, therefore, is not a Divine service: were it so, our
mind would achieve its perfect and satisfying truth.
All that we do is a mere externalism, which from these
fruits wipes off some rain-drop, some speck of dust, and
which, in place of the inward elements of moral actuality
that created and inspired them, tries from the dead
elements of their external reality, such as language and
historical allusion, to set up a tedious mass of scaffolding,
not in order to live ourselves into them, but only to form
a picture of them in our minds. But as the girl who
proffers the plucked fruits is more and nobler than the
natural element with all its details of tree, air, light,
&amp;c. which first yielded them, because she gathers all
this together, in a nobler way, into the glance of the
conscious eye and the gesture which proffers them; so
the spirit of destiny which offers us those works of art
is more than the ethical life and actuality of the ancient
people: for it is the inwardising of that mind which in
them was still self-estranged and self-dispossessed:&mdash;it
is the spirit of tragic destiny, the destiny which collects
all those individualised gods and attributes of substance
into the one Pantheon. And that temple of all the
gods is Mind conscious of itself as mind<note place='foot'>Hegel, <hi rend='italic'>Phenomenologie des Geistes</hi> (<hi rend='italic'>Werke</hi>, ii. 545). The meeting-ground
of the Greek spirit, as it passed through Rome, with Christianity.</note>.</q>
</p>

<p>
Religion enters into its more adequate form when it
ceases to appear in the guise of Art and realises that
the kingdom of God is within, that the truth must be
<emph>felt</emph>, the eternal <emph>inwardly</emph> revealed, the holy one apprehended
by <emph>faith</emph><note place='foot'>Ib., p. 584.</note>, not by outward vision. Eye hath
not seen, nor ear heard, the things of God. They cannot
<pb n='xliv'/><anchor id='Pgxliv'/>
be presented, or delineated: they come only in the
witness of the spirit. The human soul itself is the only
worthy temple of the Most High, whom heaven, and
the heaven of heavens, cannot contain. Here in truth
God has come down to dwell with men; and the Son
of Man, caught up in the effusion of the Spirit, can in
all assurance and all humility claim that he is divinified.
Here apparently Absolute Mind is reached: the soul
knows no limitation, no struggle: in time it is already
eternal. Yet, there is, according to Hegel, a flaw,&mdash;not
in the essence and the matter, but in the manner and
mode in which the ordinary religious consciousness
represents to itself, or pictures that unification which it
feels and experiences.
</p>

<p>
<q>In religion then this unification of ultimate Being
with the Self is implicitly reached. But the religious
consciousness, if it has this symbolic idea of its reconciliation,
still has it as a mere symbol or representation.
It attains the satisfaction by tacking on to its pure
negativity, and that externally, the positive signification
of its unity with the ultimate Being: its satisfaction
remains therefore tainted by the antithesis of another
world. Its own reconciliation, therefore, is presented to
its consciousness as something far away, something far
away in the future: just as the reconciliation which the
other Self accomplished appears as a far-away thing in
the past. The one Divine Man had but an implicit
father and only an actual mother; conversely the universal
divine man, the community, has its own deed
and knowledge for its father, but for its mother only
the eternal Love, which it only <emph>feels</emph>, but does not
<emph>behold</emph> in its consciousness as an actual immediate object.
Its reconciliation therefore is in its heart, but still at
variance with its consciousness, and its actuality still
has a flaw. In its field of consciousness the place of
<pb n='xlv'/><anchor id='Pgxlv'/>
implicit reality or side of pure mediation is taken by the
reconciliation that lies far away behind: the place of the
actually present, or the side of immediacy and existence,
is filled by the world which has still to wait for its
transfiguration to glory. Implicitly no doubt the world
is reconciled with the eternal Being; and that Being, it
is well known, no longer looks upon the object as alien
to it, but in its love sees it as like itself. But for
self-consciousness
this immediate presence is not yet set in
the full light of mind. In its immediate consciousness
accordingly the spirit of the community is parted from
its religious: for while the religious consciousness
declares that they are implicitly not parted, this implicitness
is not raised to reality and not yet grown to
absolute self-certainty<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Phenomenologie des Geistes</hi> (<hi rend='italic'>Werke</hi>, ii. 572). Thus Hegelian idealism
claims to be the philosophical counterpart of the central dogma
of Christianity.</note>.</q>
</p>

<p>
Religion therefore, which as it first appeared in art-worship
had yet to realise its essential inwardness or
spirituality, so has now to overcome the antithesis in which
its (the religious) consciousness stands to the secular.
For the peculiarly religious type of mind is distinguished
by an indifference and even hostility, more or less veiled,
to art, to morality and the civil state, to science and to
nature. Strong in the certainty of faith, or of its implicit
rest in God, it resents too curious inquiry into
the central mystery of its union, and in its distincter
consciousness sets the foundation of faith on the
evidence of a fact, which, however, it in the same
breath declares to be unique and miraculous, the central
event of the ages, pointing back in its reference to the
first days of humanity, and forward in the future to the
winding-up of the business of terrestrial life. Philosophy,
according to Hegel's conception of it, does but
<pb n='xlvi'/><anchor id='Pgxlvi'/>
draw the conclusion supplied by the premisses of religion:
it supplements and rounds off into coherence
the religious implications. The unique events in Judea
nearly nineteen centuries ago are for it also the first
step in a new revelation of man's relationship to God:
but while it acknowledges the transcendent interest of
that age, it lays main stress on the permanent truth
then revealed, and it insists on the duty of carrying out
the principle there awakened to all the depth and
breadth of its explication. Its task&mdash;its supreme task&mdash;is
to <emph>explicate religion</emph>. But to do so is to show that
religion is no exotic, and no <emph>mere</emph> revelation from an
external source. It is to show that religion is the
truth, the complete reality, of the mind that lived in
Art, that founded the state and sought to be dutiful and
upright: the truth, the crowning fruit of all scientific
knowledge, of all human affections, of all secular consciousness.
Its lesson ultimately is that there is nothing
essentially common or unclean: that the holy is not
parted off from the true and the good and the beautiful.
</p>

<p>
Religion thus expanded descends from its abstract or
<q>intelligible</q> world, to which it had retired from art and
science, and the affairs of ordinary life. Its God&mdash;as
a true God&mdash;is not of the dead alone, but also of the
living: not a far-off supreme and ultimate Being, but
also a man among men. Philosophy thus has to break
down the middle partition-wall of life, the fence between
secular and sacred. It is but religion come to its
maturity, made at home in the world, and no longer
a stranger and a wonder. Religion has pronounced in
its inmost heart and faith of faith, that the earth is the
Lord's, and that day unto day shows forth the divine
handiwork. But the heart of unbelief, of little faith,
has hardly uttered the word, than it forgets its assurance
and leans to the conviction that the prince of this world
<pb n='xlvii'/><anchor id='Pgxlvii'/>
is the Spirit of Evil. The mood of Théodicée is also&mdash;but
with a difference&mdash;the mood of philosophy. It
asserts the ways of Providence: but its providence is
not the God of the Moralist, or the ideal of the Artist,
or rather is not these only, but also the Law of Nature,
and more than that. Its aim is the Unity of History.
The words have sometimes been lightly used to mean
that events run on in one continuous flow, and that
there are no abrupt, no ultimate beginnings, parting
age from age. But the Unity of History in its full
sense is beyond history: it is history <q>reduced</q> from
the expanses of time to the eternal present: its thousand
years made one day,&mdash;made even the glance of a
moment. The theme of the Unity of History&mdash;in the
full depth of unity and the full expanse of history&mdash;is
the theme of Hegelian philosophy. It traces the
process in which Mind has to be all-inclusive, self-upholding,
one with the Eternal reality.
</p>

<p>
<q>That process of the mind's self-realisation</q> says
Hegel in the close of his <hi rend='italic'>Phenomenology</hi>, <q>exhibits
a lingering movement and succession of minds, a gallery
of images, each of which, equipped with the complete
wealth of mind, only seems to linger because the Self
has to penetrate and to digest this wealth of its
Substance. As its perfection consists in coming
completely to <emph>know</emph> what it <emph>is</emph> (its substance), this knowledge
is its self-involution in which it deserts its
outward existence and surrenders its shape to recollection.
Thus self-involved, it is sunk in the night of its
self-consciousness: but in that night its vanished being
is preserved, and that being, thus in idea preserved,&mdash;old,
but now new-born of the spirit,&mdash;is the new sphere
of being, a new world, a new phase of mind. In this
new phase it has again to begin afresh and from the
beginning, and again nurture itself to maturity from its
<pb n='xlviii'/><anchor id='Pgxlviii'/>
own resources, as if for it all that preceded were lost,
and it had learned nothing from the experience of the
earlier minds. Yet is that recollection a preservation
of experience: it is the quintessence, and in fact a higher
form, of the substance. If therefore this new mind
appears only to count on its own resources, and to start
quite fresh and blank, it is at the same time on a higher
grade that it starts. The intellectual and spiritual
realm, which is thus constructed in actuality, forms
a succession in time, where one mind relieved another
of its watch, and each took over the kingdom of the
world from the preceding. The purpose of that succession
is to reveal the depth, and that depth is the absolute
comprehension of mind: this revelation is therefore to
uplift its depth, to spread it out in breadth, so negativing
this self-involved Ego, wherein it is self-dispossessed
or reduced to substance. But it is also its time: the
course of time shows this dispossession itself dispossessed,
and thus in its extension it is no less in its
depth, the self. The way to that goal,&mdash;absolute self-certainty&mdash;or
the mind knowing itself as mind&mdash;is the
inwardising of the minds, as they severally are in
themselves, and as they accomplish the organisation of
their realm. Their conservation,&mdash;regarded on the side
of its free and apparently contingent succession of fact&mdash;is
history: on the side of their comprehended
organisation, again, it is the science of mental phenomenology:
the two together, comprehended history, form
at once the recollection and the grave-yard of the
absolute Mind, the actuality, truth, and certitude of his
throne, apart from which he were lifeless and alone.</q>
</p>

<p>
Such in brief outline&mdash;lingering most on the points
where Hegel has here been briefest&mdash;is the range of
the Philosophy of Mind. Its aim is to comprehend,
not to explain: to put together in intelligent unity,
<pb n='xlix'/><anchor id='Pgxlix'/>
not to analyse into a series of elements. For it
psychology is not an analysis or description of mental
phenomena, of laws of association, of the growth of
certain powers and ideas, but a <q>comprehended history</q>
of the formation of subjective mind, of the intelligent,
feeling, willing self or ego. For it Ethics is part and
only part of the great scheme or system of self-development;
but continuing into greater concreteness the
normal endowment of the individual mind, and but
preparing the ground on which religion may be most
effectively cultivated. And finally Religion itself,
released from its isolation and other-world sacrosanctity,
is shown to be only the crown of life, the
ripest growth of actuality, and shown to be so by
philosophy, whilst it is made clear that religion is the
basis of philosophy, or that a philosophy can only go as
far as the religious stand-point allows. The hierarchy,
if so it be called, of the spiritual forces is one where
none can stand alone, or claim an abstract and independent
supremacy. The truth of egoism is the truth of
altruism: the truly moral is the truly religious: and
each is not what it professes to be unless it anticipate
the later, or include the earlier.
</p>

</div>

<div>
<head>(iv.) Mind or Spirit.</head>

<p>
It may be said, however, that for such a range of
subjects the term Mind is wretchedly inadequate and
common-place, and that the better rendering of the title
would be Philosophy of Spirit. It may be admitted
that Mind is not all that could be wished. But neither
is Spirit blameless. And, it may be added, Hegel's
<pb n='l'/><anchor id='Pgl'/>
own term <foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Geist</foreign> has to be unduly strained to cover so
wide a region. It serves&mdash;and was no doubt meant to
serve&mdash;as a sign of the conformity of his system with
the religion which sees in God no other-world being,
but our very self and mind, and which worships him in
spirit and in truth. And if the use of a word like this
could allay the <q>ancient variance</q> between the religious
and the philosophic mood, it would be but churlish
perhaps to refuse the sign of compliance and compromise.
But whatever may be the case in German,&mdash;and
even there the new wine was dangerous to the old
wine-skin&mdash;it is certain that to average English ears
the word Spiritual would carry us over the medium line
into the proper land of religiosity. And to do that, as
we have seen, is to sin against the central idea: the idea
that religion is of one blood with the whole mental family,
though the most graciously complete of all the sisters.
Yet, however the word may be chosen, the philosophy
of Hegel, like the august lady who appeared in vision
to the emprisoned Boëthius, has on her garment a sign
which <q>signifies the life which is on earth,</q> as also a sign
which signifies the <q>right law of heaven</q>; if her right-hand
holds the <q>book of the justice of the King
omnipotent,</q> the sceptre in her left is <q>corporal
judgment against sin<note place='foot'>From the old Provençal <hi rend='italic'>Lay of Boëthius</hi>.</note>.</q>
</p>

<p>
There is indeed no sufficient reason for contemning
the term Mind. If Inductive Philosophy of the Human
Mind has&mdash;perhaps to a dainty taste&mdash;made the word
unsavoury, that is no reason for refusing to give it all
the wealth of soul and heart, of intellect and will. The
<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>mens aeterna</foreign> which, if we hear Tacitus, expressed the
Hebrew conception of the spirituality of God, and the
Νοῦς which Aristotelianism set supreme in the Soul,
are not the mere or abstract intelligence, which late-acquired
<pb n='li'/><anchor id='Pgli'/>
habits of abstraction have made out of them.
If the reader will adopt the term (in want of a better) in its
widest scope, we may shelter ourselves under the example
of Wordsworth. His theme is&mdash;as he describes it in

<head>Essay II. Aims And Methods Of Psychology.</head>

<p>
It is not going too far to say that in common estimation
psychology has as yet hardly reached what Kant
has called the steady walk of science&mdash;<foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>der sichere Gang
der Wissenschaft</foreign>. To assert this is not, of course, to
throw any doubts on the importance of the problems, or
on the intrinsic value of the results, in the studies which
have been prosecuted under that name. It is only to
note the obvious fact that a number of inquiries of
somewhat discrepant tone, method, and tendency have
all at different times covered themselves under the
common title of psychological, and that the work of
orientation is as yet incomplete. Such a destiny seems
inevitable, when a name is coined rather as the title of
an unexplored territory, than fixed on to describe an
accomplished fact.

<div>
<head>(i.) Psychology as a Science and as a
Part of Philosophy.</head>

<p>
The <hi rend='italic'>De Anima</hi> of Aristotle, gathering up into one
the work of Plato and his predecessors, may be said to
lay the foundation of psychology. But even in it, we
can already see that there are two elements or aspects
struggling for mastery: two elements not unrelated or
<pb n='liv'/><anchor id='Pgliv'/>
independent, but hard to keep fairly and fully in unity.
On one hand there is the conception of Soul as a part
of Nature, as a grade of existence in the physical or
natural universe,&mdash;in the universe of things which
suffer growth and change, which are never entirely
<q>without matter,</q> and are always attached to or present
in body. From this point of view Aristotle urged that
a sound and realistic psychology must, e.g. in its
definition of a passion, give the prominent place to its
physical (or material) expression, and not to its mental
form or significance. It must remember, he said, that
the phenomena or <q>accidents</q> are what really throw
light on the nature or the <q>substance</q> of the Soul. On
the other hand, there are two points to be considered.
There is, first of all, the counterpoising remark that the
conception of Soul as such, as a unity and common
characteristic, will be determinative of the phenomena
or <q>accidents,</q>&mdash;will settle, as it were, what we are to
observe and look for, and how we are to describe our
observations. And by the <emph>conception</emph> of Soul, is meant
not <emph>a</emph> soul, as a thing or agent (subject) which has
properties attaching to it; but soul, as the generic
feature, the universal, which is set as a stamp on
everything that claims to be psychical. In other words,
Soul is one, not as a single thing contrasted with its
attributes, activities, or exercises of force (such single
thing will be shown by logic to be a metaphysical fiction);
but as the unity of form and character, the comprehensive
and identical feature, which is present in all its manifestations
and exercises. But there is a second consideration.
The question is asked by Aristotle whether it is completely
and strictly accurate to put Soul under the
category of natural objects. There is in it, or of it,
perhaps, something, and something essential to it, which
belongs to the order of the eternal and self-active:
<pb n='lv'/><anchor id='Pglv'/>
something which is <q>form</q> and <q>energy</q> quite unaffected
by and separate from <q>matter.</q> How this is related to
the realm of the perishable and changeable is a problem
on which Aristotle has been often (and with some reason)
believed to be obscure, if not even inconsistent<note place='foot'>It is the doctrine of the <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>intellectus agens</foreign>, or <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>in actu</foreign>; the <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>actus
purus</foreign> of the Schoolmen.</note>.
</p>

<p>
In these divergent elements which come to the fore
in Aristotle's treatment we have the appearance of
a radical difference of conception and purpose as to
psychology. He himself does a good deal to keep them
both in view. But it is evident that here already we
have the contrast between a purely physical or (in the
narrower sense) <q>scientific</q> psychology, empirical and
realistic in treatment, and a more philosophical&mdash;what
in certain quarters would be called a speculative or
metaphysical&mdash;conception of the problem. There is
also in Aristotle the antithesis of a popular or superficial,
and an accurate or analytic, psychology. The former
is of a certain use in dealing, say, with questions of
practical ethics and education: the latter is of more
strictly scientific interest. Both of these distinctions&mdash;that
between a speculative and an empirical, and that
between a scientific and a popular treatment&mdash;affect the
subsequent history of the study. Psychology is sometimes
understood to mean the results of casual observation
of our own minds by what is termed introspection,
and by the interpretation of what we may observe in
others. Such observations are in the first place carried
on under the guidance of distinctions or points of view
supplied by the names in common use. We interrogate
our own consciousness as to what facts or relations of
facts correspond to the terms of our national language.
Or we attempt&mdash;what is really an inexhaustible quest&mdash;to
get definite divisions between them, and clear-cut
<pb n='lvi'/><anchor id='Pglvi'/>
definitions. Inquiries like these which start from
popular distinctions fall a long way short of science:
and the inquirer will find that accidental and essential
properties are given in the same handful of conclusions.
Yet there is always much value in these attempts to
get our minds cleared: and it is indispensable for all
inquiries that all alleged or reported facts of mind
should be realised and reproduced in our own mental
experience. And this is especially the case in psychology,
just because here we cannot get the object
outside us, we cannot get or make a diagram, and
unless we give it reality by re-constructing it,&mdash;by
re-interrogating our own experience, our knowledge
of it will be but wooden and mechanical. And the
term introspection need not be too seriously taken: it
means much more than watching passively an internal
drama; and is quite as well describable as mental
projection, setting out what was within, and so as it
were hidden and involved, before ourselves in the field
of mental vision. Here, as always, the essential point
is to get ourselves well out of the way of the object
observed, and to stand, figuratively speaking, quite on
one side.
</p>

<p>
But even at the best, such a popular or empirical psychology
has no special claim to be ranked as science. It
may no doubt be said that at least it collects, describes,
or notes down facts. But even this is not so certain
as it seems. Its so-called facts are very largely fictions,
or so largely interpolated with error, that they cannot
be safely used for construction. If psychology is to
accomplish anything valuable, it must go more radically
to work. It must&mdash;at least in a measure&mdash;discard from
its preliminary view the data of common and current
distinctions, and try to get at something more primary
or ultimate as its starting-point. And this it may do in
<pb n='lvii'/><anchor id='Pglvii'/>
two ways. It may, in the one case, follow the example
of the physical sciences. In these it is the universal
practice to assume that the explanation of complex and
concrete facts is to be attained by (<hi rend='italic'>a</hi>) postulating certain
simple elements (which we may call atoms, molecules,
and perhaps units or monads), which are supposed to
be clearly conceivable and to justify themselves by intrinsic
intelligibility, and by (<hi rend='italic'>b</hi>) assuming that these
elements are compounded and combined according to
laws which again are in the last resort self-evident, or
such that they seem to have an obvious and palpable
lucidity. Further, such laws being always axioms or
plain postulates of mechanics (for these alone possess
this feature of self-evident intelligibility), they are subject
to and invite all the aids and refinements of the
higher mathematical calculus. What the primary and
self-explicative bits of psychical reality may be, is a
further question on which there may be some dispute.
They may be, so to say, taken in a more physical or in
a more metaphysical way: i.e. more as units of nerve-function
or more as elements of ideative-function. And
there may be differences as to how far and in what
provinces the mathematical calculus may be applicable.
But, in any case, there will be a strong tendency in
psychology, worked on this plan, to follow, <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>mutatis
mutandis</foreign>, and at some distance perhaps, the analogy of
material physics. In both the justification of the
postulated units and laws will be their ability to describe
and systematise the observed phenomena in a uniform
and consistent way.
</p>

<p>
The other way in which psychology gets a foundation
and ulterior certainty is different, and goes deeper.
After all, the <q>scientific</q> method is only a way in which
the facts of a given sphere are presented in thoroughgoing
interconnexion, each reduced to an exact multiple
<pb n='lviii'/><anchor id='Pglviii'/>
or fraction of some other, by an inimitably continued
subtraction and addition of an assumed homogeneous
element, found or assumed to be perfectly imaginable
(conceivable). But we may also consider the province
in relation to the whole sphere of reality, may ask what
is its place and meaning in the whole, what reality is in
the end driving at or coming to be, and how far this
special province contributes to that end. If we do this,
we attach psychology to philosophy, or, if we prefer so
to call it, to metaphysics, as in the former way we
established it on the principles generally received as
governing the method of the physical sciences.
</p>

<p>
This&mdash;the relation of psychology to fundamental
philosophy&mdash;is a question which also turns up in dealing
with Ethics. There is on the part of those engaged
in either of these inquiries a certain impatience against
the intermeddling (which is held to be only muddling)
of metaphysics with them. It is clear that in a very
decided way both psychology and ethics can, up to some
extent at least, be treated as what is called empirical
(or, to use the more English phrase, inductive) sciences.
On many hands they are actually so treated: and not
without result. Considering the tendency of metaphysical
inquiries, it may be urged that it is well to avoid preliminary
criticism of the current conceptions and beliefs
about reality which these sciences imply. Yet such
beliefs are undoubtedly present and effective. Schopenhauer
has popularised the principle that the pure
empiricist is a fiction, that man is a radically metaphysical
animal, and that he inevitably turns what he
receives into a part of a dogmatic creed&mdash;a conviction
how things ought to be. Almost without effort there
grows up in him, or flows in upon him, a belief and a
system of beliefs as to the order and values of things.
Every judgment, even in logic, rests on such an order
<pb n='lix'/><anchor id='Pglix'/>
of truth. He need not be able to formulate his creed:
it will influence him none the less: nay, his faith will
probably seem more a part of the solid earth and common
reality, the less it has been reduced to a determinate
creed or to a code of principles. For such
formulation presupposes doubt and scepticism, which it
beats back by mere assertion. Each human being
has such a background of convictions which govern
his actions and conceptions, and of which it so startles
him to suggest the possibility of a doubt, that he turns
away in dogmatic horror. Such ruling ideas vary,
from man to man, and from man to woman&mdash;if we consider
them in all their minuteness. But above all they
constitute themselves in a differently organised system
or aggregate according to the social and educational
stratum to which an individual belongs. Each group,
engaged in a common task, it may be in the study of a
part of nature, is ideally bound and obliged by a common
language, and special standards of truth and reality
for its own. Such a group of ideas is what Bacon
would have called a scientific fetich or <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>idolum theatri</foreign>. A
scientific <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>idolum</foreign> is a traditional belief or dogma as to
principles, values, and methods, which has so thoroughly
pervaded the minds of those engaged in a branch of
inquiry, that they no longer recognise its hypothetical
character,&mdash;its relation of means to the main end of their
function.
</p>

<p>
Such a collected and united theory of reality (it
is what Hegel has designated the Idea) is what is
understood by a natural metaphysic. It has nothing
necessarily to do with a supersensible or a supernatural,
if these words mean a ghostly, materialised, but super-finely-materialised
nature, above and beyond the present.
But that there is a persistent tendency to conceive
the unity and coherence, the theoretic idea of reality,
<pb n='lx'/><anchor id='Pglx'/>
in this pseudo-sensuous (i.e. super-sensuous) form, is
of course a well-known fact. For the present, however,
this aberration&mdash;this idol of the tribe&mdash;may be left out
of sight. By a metaphysic or fundamental philosophy, is,
in the present instance, meant a system of first principles&mdash;a
secular and cosmic creed: a belief in ends and
values, a belief in truth&mdash;again premising that the system
in question is, for most, a rudely organised and
almost inarticulate mass of belief and hope, conviction
and impression. It is, in short, a <emph>natural</emph> metaphysic:
a metaphysic, that is, which has but an imperfect
coherence, which imperfectly realises both its nature
and its limits.
</p>

<p>
In certain parts, however, it is more and better than
this crude background of belief. Each science&mdash;or at
least every group of sciences&mdash;has a more definite system
or aggregate of first principles, axioms, and conceptions
belonging to it. It has, that is,&mdash;and here
in a much distincter way&mdash;its special standard of reality,
its peculiar forms of conceiving things, its distinctions
between the actual and the apparent, &amp;c. Here again
it will probably be found that the scientific specialist is
hardly conscious that these are principles and concepts:
on the contrary, they will be supposed self-evident and
ultimate facts, foundations of being. Instead of being
treated as modes of conception, more or less justified by
their use and their results, these categories will be
regarded as fundamental facts, essential conditions of
all reality. Like popular thought in its ingrained
categories, the specialist cannot understand the possibility
of any limitation to his radical ideas of reality.
To him they are not hypotheses, but principles. The
scientific specialist may be as convinced of the universal
application of his peculiar categories, as the Chinese or
the Eskimo that his standards are natural and final.
</p>

<pb n='lxi'/><anchor id='Pglxi'/>

<p>
Under such metaphysical or extra-empirical presuppositions
all investigation, whether it be crudely empirical
or (in the physical sense) scientific, is carried on.
And when so carried on, it is said to be prosecuted
apart from any interference from metaphysic. Such
a naïve or natural metaphysic, not raised to explicit
consciousness, not followed as an imposed rule, but
governing with the strength of an immanent faith, does
not count for those who live under it as a metaphysic
at all. M. Jourdain was amazed suddenly to learn he
had been speaking prose for forty years without knowing
it. But in the present case there is something
worse than amazement sure to be excited by the news.
For the critic who thus reveals the secrets of the
scientist's heart is pretty sure to go on to say that a
good deal of this naïve unconscious metaphysic is incoherent,
contradictory, even bad: that it requires correction,
revision, and readjustment, and has by criticism
to be made one and harmonious. That readjustment or
criticism which shall eliminate contradiction and produce
unity, is the aim of the <emph>science</emph> of metaphysic&mdash;the
science of the meta-physical element in physical
knowledge: what Hegel has chosen to call the Science
of Logic (in the wide sense of the term). This higher
Logic, this <emph>science</emph> of metaphysic, is the process to revise
and harmonise in systematic completeness the
imperfect or misleading and partial estimates of reality
which are to be found in popular and scientific thought.
</p>

<p>
In the case of the run of physical sciences this
revision is less necessary; and for no very recondite
reason. Every science by its very nature deals with a
special, a limited topic. It is confined to a part or
aspect of reality. Its propositions are not complete
truths; they apply to an artificial world, to a part
expressly cut off from the concrete reality. Its principles
<pb n='lxii'/><anchor id='Pglxii'/>
are generally cut according to their cloth,&mdash;according
to the range in which they apply. The only
danger that can well arise is if these categories are
transplanted without due reservations, and made of
universal application, i.e. if the scientist elects on his
speciality to pronounce <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>de omnibus rebus</foreign>. But in the
case of psychology and ethics the harmlessness of
natural metaphysics will be less certain. Here a
general human or universal interest is almost an inevitable
coefficient: especially if they really rise to the
full sweep of the subject. For as such they both seem
to deal not with a part of reality, but with the very
centre and purpose of all reality. In them we are not
dealing with topics of secondary interest, but with the
very heart of the human problem. Here the questions
of reality and ideals, of unity and diversity, and of the
evaluation of existence, come distinctly to the fore. If
psychology is to answer the question, What am I?
and ethics the question, What ought I to do? they
can hardly work without some formulated creed of
metaphysical character, without some preliminary criticisms
of current first principles.
</p>

<div>
<head>(ii.) Herbart.</head>

<p>
The German thinker, who has given perhaps the
most fruitful stimulus to the scientific study of psychology
in modern times&mdash;Johann Friedrich Herbart&mdash;is
after all essentially a philosopher, and not a mere
scientist, even in his psychology. His psychological
inquiry, that is, stands in intimate connexion with the
last questions of all intelligence, with metaphysics and
<pb n='lxiii'/><anchor id='Pglxiii'/>
ethics. The business of philosophy, says Herbart, is
to touch up and finish off conceptions (<foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Bearbeitung der
Begriffe</foreign>)<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Einleitung in die Philosophie</hi>, §§ 1, 2.</note>. It finds, as it supervenes upon the unphilosophical
world, that mere and pure facts (if there
ever are or were such purisms) have been enveloped
in a cloud of theory, have been construed into some
form of unity, but have been imperfectly, inadequately
construed: and that the existing concepts in current
use need to be corrected, supplemented and readjusted.
It has, accordingly, for its work to <q>reconcile experience
with itself<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Psychologie als Wissenschaft</hi>, Vorrede.</note>,</q> and to elicit <q>the hidden pre-suppositions
without which the fact of experience is unthinkable.</q>
Psychology, then, as a branch of this philosophic enterprise,
has to readjust the facts discovered in inner
experience. For mere uncritical experience or merely
empirical knowledge only offers <emph>problems</emph>; it suggests
gaps, which indeed further reflection serves at first
only to deepen into contradictions. Such a psychology
is <q>speculative</q>: i.e. it is not content to accept the
mere given, but goes forward and backward to find
something that will make the fact intelligible. It employs
totally different methods from the <q>classification,
induction, analogy</q> familiar to the logic of the empirical
sciences. Its <q>principles,</q> therefore, are not given
facts: but facts which have been manipulated and
adjusted so as to lose their self-contradictory quality:
they are facts <q>reduced,</q> by introducing the omitted
relationships which they postulate if they are to be
true and self-consistent<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Einleitung in die Philosophie</hi>, §§ 11, 12.</note>. While it is far from rejecting
or ignoring experience, therefore, psychology cannot
strictly be said to build upon it alone. It uses experimental
fact as an unfinished datum,&mdash;or it sees in
<pb n='lxiv'/><anchor id='Pglxiv'/>
experience a torso which betrays its imperfection, and
suggests completing.
</p>

<p>
The starting-point, it may be said, of Herbart's psychology
is a question which to the ordinary psychologist
(and to the so-called scientific psychologist) has a
secondary, if it have any interest. It was, he says, the
problem of Personality, the problem of the Self or Ego,
which first led to his characteristic conception of psychological
method. <q>My first discovery,</q> he tells us<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Einleitung in die Philosophie</hi>, § 18: cf. <hi rend='italic'>Werke</hi>, ed. Kehrbach, v. 108.</note>,
<q>was that the Self was neither primitive nor independent,
but must be the most dependent and most conditioned
thing one can imagine. The second was that
the elementary ideas of an intelligent being, if they
were ever to reach the pitch of self-consciousness,
must be either all, or at least in part, opposed to each
other, and that they must check or block one another
in consequence of this opposition. Though held in
check, however, these ideas were not to be supposed
lost: they subsist as endeavours or tendencies to
return into the position of actual idea, as soon as the
check became, for any reason, either in whole or in
part inoperative. This check could and must be calculated,
and thus it was clear that psychology required
a mathematical as well as a metaphysical foundation.</q>
</p>

<p>
The place of the conception of the Ego in Kant's
and Fichte's theory of knowledge is well known. Equally
well known is Kant's treatment of the soul-reality or
soul-substance in his examination of Rational Psychology.
Whereas the (logical) unity of consciousness,
or <q>synthetic unity of apperception,</q> is assumed as a
fundamental starting-point in explanation of our objective
judgments, or of our knowledge of objective
existence, its real (as opposed to its formal) foundation
in a <q>substantial</q> soul is set aside as an illegitimate
<pb n='lxv'/><anchor id='Pglxv'/>
interpretation of, or inference from, the facts of inner
experience. The belief in the separate unity and persistence
of the soul, said Kant, is not a scientifically-warranted
conclusion. Its true place is as an ineffaceable
postulate of the faith which inspires human life
and action. Herbart did not rest content with either of
these&mdash;as he believed&mdash;dogmatic assumptions of his
master. He did not fall in cheerfully with the idealism
which seemed ready to dispense with a soul, or which
justified its acceptance of empirical reality by referring
to the fundamental unity of the function of judgment.
With a strong bent towards fully-differentiated and individualised
experience Herbart conjoined a conviction of
the need of logical analysis to prevent us being carried
away by the first-come and inadequate generalities.
The Ego which, in its extremest abstraction, he found
defined as the unity of subject and object, did not seem
to him to offer the proper guarantees of reality: it was
itself a problem, full of contradictions, waiting for solution.
On the other hand, the real Ego, or self of
concrete experience, is very much more than this logical
abstract, and differs widely from individual to individual,
and apparently from time to time even in the
same individual. Our self, of which we talk so fluently,
as one and the self-same&mdash;how far does it really possess
the continuity and identity with which we credit it?
Does it not rather seem to be an ideal which we gradually
form and set before ourselves as the standard for
measuring our attainments of the moment,&mdash;the perfect
fulfilment of that oneness of being and purpose and
knowledge which we never reach? Sometimes even
it seems no better than a name which we move along
the varying phenomena of our inner life, at one time
identifying it with the power which has gained the
victory in a moral struggle, at another with that which
<pb n='lxvi'/><anchor id='Pglxvi'/>
has been defeated<note place='foot'>Cf. Plato's remarks on the problem in the word Self-control.
<hi rend='italic'>Republ.</hi> 430-1.</note>, according as the attitude of the
moment makes us throw now one, now another, aspect
of mental activity in the foreground.
</p>

<p>
The other&mdash;or logical Ego&mdash;the mere identity of
subject and object,&mdash;when taken in its utter abstractness
and simplicity, shrivels up to something very small
indeed&mdash;to a something which is little better than
nothing. The mere <emph>I</emph> which is not contra-distinguished
by a <emph>Thou</emph> and a <emph>He</emph>&mdash;which is without all definiteness
of predication (the I=I of Fichte and Schelling)&mdash;is
only as it were a point of being cut off from all its
connexions in reality, and treated as if it were or could
be entirely independent. It is an identity in which
subject and object have not yet appeared: it is not a real
I, though we may still retain the name. It is&mdash;as
Hegel's <hi rend='italic'>Logic</hi> will tell us&mdash;exactly definable as Being,
which is as yet Nothing: the impossible edge of abstraction
on which we try&mdash;and in vain&mdash;to steady ourselves
at the initial point of thought. And to reach or stand
at that intangible, ungraspable point, which slips away
as we approach, and transmutes itself as we hold it, is
not the natural beginning, but the result of introspection
and reflection on the concrete self. But with this aspect
of the question we are not now concerned.
</p>

<p>
That the unity of the Self as an intelligent and moral
being, that the Ego of self-consciousness was an ideal
and a product of development, was what Herbart soon
became convinced of. The unity of Self is even as given
in mature experience an imperfect fact. It is a fact,
that is, which does not come up to what it promised, and
which requires to be supplemented, or philosophically
justified. Here and everywhere the custom of life
carries us over gaps which yawn deep to the eye of
<pb n='lxvii'/><anchor id='Pglxvii'/>
philosophic reflection: even though accident and illness
force them not unfrequently even upon the blindest.
To trace the process of unification towards this unity&mdash;to
trace, if you like, even the formation of the concept of
such unity, as a governing and guiding principle in life
and conduct, comes to be the problem of the psychologist,
in the largest sense of that problem. From Soul
(<foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Seele</foreign>) to Mind or Spirit (<foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Geist</foreign>) is for Herbart, as for
Hegel, the course of psychology<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Lehrbuch der Psychologie</hi>, §§ 202, 203.</note>. The growth and
development of mind, the formation of a self, the realisation
of a personality, is for both the theme which
psychology has to expound. And Herbart, not less
than Hegel, had to bear the censure that such a conception
of mental reality as a growth would destroy
personality<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Allgemeine Metaphysik</hi>, Vorrede.</note>.
</p>

<p>
But with so much common in the general plan, the
two thinkers differ profoundly in their special mode of
carrying out the task. Or, rather, they turn their
strength on different departments of the whole. Herbart's
great practical interest had been the theory of
education: <q>paedagogic</q> is the subject of his first important
writings. The inner history of ideas&mdash;the processes
which are based on the interaction of elements in the
individual soul&mdash;are what he specially traces. Hegel's
interests, on the contrary, are more towards the greater
process, the unities of historical life, and the correlations
of the powers of art, religion, and philosophy that
work therein. He turns to the macrocosm, almost as
naturally as Herbart does to the microcosm. Thus,
even in Ethics, while Herbart gives a delicate analysis
of the distinct aspects or elements in the Ethical idea,&mdash;the
diverse headings under which the disinterested spectator
within the breast measures with purely aesthetic
<pb n='lxviii'/><anchor id='Pglxviii'/>
eye his approach to unity and strength of purpose,
Hegel seems to hurry away from the field of moral sense
or conscience to throw himself on the social and political
organisation of the moral life. The General Paedagogic
of Herbart has its pendant in Hegel's Philosophy of Law
and of History.
</p>

<p>
At an early period Herbart had become impressed
with the necessity of applying mathematics to psychology<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Hauptpunkte der Metaphysik</hi> (1806), § 13.</note>.
To the usual objection, that psychical facts do
not admit of measurement, he had a ready reply. We
can calculate even on hypothetical assumptions: indeed,
could we measure, we should scarcely take the trouble
to calculate<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Werke</hi>, ed. Kehrbach (<hi rend='italic'>Ueber die Möglichkeit</hi>, &amp;c), v. 96.</note>. To calculate (i.e. to deduce mathematically)
is to perform a general experiment, and to perform
it in the medium where there is least likelihood of error
or disturbance. There may be anomalies enough
apparent in the mental life: there may be the great
anomalies of Genius and of Freedom of Will; but the
Newton and the Kepler of psychology will show by
calculation on assumed conditions of psychic nature
that these aberrations can be explained by mechanical
laws. <q>The human Soul is no puppet-theatre: our
wishes and resolutions are no marionettes: no juggler
stands behind; but our true and proper life lies in our
volition, and this life has its rule not outside, but in
itself: it has its own purely mental rule, by no means
borrowed from the material world. But this rule is in
it sure and fixed; and on account of this its fixed
quality it has more similarity to (what is otherwise
heterogeneous) the laws of impact and pressure than
to the marvels of an alleged inexplicable freedom<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Ibid.</hi>, p. 100.</note>.</q>
</p>

<p>
Psychology then deals with a real, which exhibits
<pb n='lxix'/><anchor id='Pglxix'/>
phenomena analogous in several respects to those
discussed by statics and mechanics. Its foundation is
a statics and mechanics of the Soul,&mdash;as this real is
called. We begin by presupposing as the ultimate
reality, underlying the factitious and generally imperfect
unity of self-consciousness and mind, an essential
and primary unity&mdash;the unity of an absolutely simple or
individual point of being&mdash;a real point which amongst
other points asserts itself, maintains itself. It has
a character of its own, but that character it only shows
in and through a development conditioned by external
influences. The specific nature of the soul-reality is to
be representative, to produce, or manifest itself in,
ideas (<foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Vorstellungen</foreign>). But the character only emerges
into actuality in the conflict of the soul-atom with other
ultimate realities in the congregation of things. A soul
<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>per se</foreign> or isolated is not possessed of ideas. It is merely
blank, undeveloped, formal unity, of which nothing can
be said. But like other realities it defines and characterises
itself by antithesis, by resistance: it shows what
it is by its behaviour in the struggle for existence. It
acts in self-defence: and its peculiar style or weapon of
self-defence is an idea or representation. The way the
Soul maintains itself is by turning the assailant into an
idea<note place='foot'>One might almost fancy Herbart was translating into a general
philosophic thesis the words in which Goethe has described how he
overcame a real trouble by transmuting it into an ideal shape, e.g.
<hi rend='italic'>Wahrheit und Dichtung</hi>, cap. xii.</note>: and each idea is therefore a <foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Selbsterhaltung</foreign> of
the Soul. The Soul is thus enriched&mdash;to appearance
or incidentally: and the assailant is annexed. In this
way the one Soul may develop or evolve or express an
innumerable variety of ideas: for in response to whatever
it meets, the living and active Soul ideates, or
gives rise to a representation. Thus, while the soul is
<pb n='lxx'/><anchor id='Pglxx'/>
one, its ideas or representations are many. Taken
separately, they each express the psychic self-conservation.
But brought in relation with each other, as so
many acts or self-affirmations of the one soul, they
behave as forces, and tend to thwart or check each
other. It is as forces, as reciprocally arresting or fostering
each other, that ideas are objects of science. When
a representation is thus held in check, it is reduced to
a mere endeavour or active tendency to represent.
Thus there arises a distinction between representations
proper, and those imperfect states or acts which are
partly or wholly held in abeyance. But the latent phase
of an idea is as essential to a thorough understanding
of it as what appears. It is the great blunder of empirical
psychology to ignore what is sunk below the surface
of consciousness. And to Herbart consciousness is
not the condition but rather the product of ideas, which
are primarily forces.
</p>

<p>
But representations are not merely in opposition,&mdash;impinging
and resisting. The same reason which
makes them resist, viz. that they are or would fain be
acts of the one soul, but are more or less incompatible,
leads them in other circumstances to form combinations
with each other. These combinations are of two sorts.
They are, first, complications, or <q>complexions</q>:
a number of ideas combine by quasi-addition and juxtaposition
to form a total. Second, there is fusion: ideas
presenting certain degrees of contrast enter into a union
where the parts are no longer separately perceptible.
It is easy to see how the problems of psychology now
assume the form of a statics and mechanics of the mind.
Quantitative data are to be sought in the strength of
each separate single idea, and the degree in which two
or more ideas block each other: in the degree of combination
between ideas, and the number of ideas in
<pb n='lxxi'/><anchor id='Pglxxi'/>
a combination: and in the terms of relation between
the members of a series of ideas. A statical theory has
to show the conditions required for what we may call
the ideal state of equilibrium of the <q>idea-forces</q>: to
determine, that is, the ultimate degree of obscuration
suffered by any two ideas of different strength, and the
conditions of their permanent combination or fusion.
A mechanics of the mind will, on the contrary, deal with
the rate at which these processes are brought about, the
velocity with which in the movement of mind ideas are
obscured or reawakened, &amp;c.
</p>

<p>
It is fortunately unnecessary, here, to go further into
details. What Herbart proposes is not a method for
the mathematical measurement of psychic facts: it is
a theory of mechanics and statics specially adapted to
the peculiarities of psychical phenomena, where the
forces are given with no sine or cosine, where instead
of gravitation we have the constant effort (as it were
elasticity) of each idea to revert to its unchecked state.
He claims&mdash;in short&mdash;practically to be a Kepler and
Newton of the mind, and in so doing to justify the
vague professions of more than one writer on mind&mdash;above
all, perhaps of David Hume, who goes beyond
mere professions&mdash;to make mental science follow the
example of physics. And a main argument in favour of
his enterprise is the declaration of Kant that no body of
knowledge can claim to be a science except in such
proportion as it is mathematical. And the peculiarity
of this enterprise is that self-consciousness, the Ego, is
not allowed to interfere with the free play of psychic
forces. The Ego is&mdash;psychologically&mdash;the result, the
product, and the varying product of that play. The
play of forces is no doubt a unity: but its unity lies not
in the synthesis of consciousness, but in the essential
unity of Soul. And Soul is in its essence neither
<pb n='lxxii'/><anchor id='Pglxxii'/>
consciousness, nor self-consciousness, nor mind: but
something on the basis of whose unity these are built
up and developed<note place='foot'>Herbart's language is almost identical with Hegel's: <hi rend='italic'>Encycl.</hi> § 389
(p. 12). Cf. Spencer, <hi rend='italic'>Psychology</hi>, i. 192. <q>Feelings are in all cases
the materials out of which the superior tracts of consciousness and
intellect are evolved.</q></note>. The mere <q>representation</q> does
not include the further supervenience of consciousness:
it represents, but it is not as yet necessary that we
should also be conscious that there is representation.
It is, in the phrase of Leibniz, perception: but not
apperception. It is mere straight-out, not as yet reflected,
representation. Gradually there emerges through
the operation of mechanical psychics a nucleus, a
floating unity, a fixed or definite central aggregate.
</p>

<p>
The suggestion of mathematical method has been
taken up by subsequent inquirers (as it was pursued
even before Herbart's time), but not in the sense he
meant. Experimentation has now taken a prominent
place in psychology. But in proportion as it has done
so, psychology has lost its native character, and thrown
itself into the arms of physiology. What Herbart calculated
were actions and reactions of idea-forces: what
the modern experimental school proposes to measure are
to a large extent the velocities of certain physiological
processes, the numerical specification of certain facts.
Such ascertainments are unquestionably useful; as
numerical precision is in other departments. But,
taken in themselves, they do not carry us one bit
further on the way to science. As experiments, further,&mdash;to
note a point discussed elsewhere<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Prolegomena to the Study of Hegel</hi>, ch. xvii.</note>&mdash;their
value depends on the point of view, on the theory which
has led to them, on the value of the general scheme for
which they are intended to provide a special new
<pb n='lxxiii'/><anchor id='Pglxxiii'/>
determination. In many cases they serve to give
a vivid reality to what was veiled under a general
phrase. The truth looks so much more real when it is
put in figures: as the size of a huge tree when set
against a rock; or as when Milton bodies out his fallen
angel by setting forth the ratio between his spear and
the tallest Norway pine. But until the general relationship
between soul and body is more clearly formulated,
such statistics will have but a value of curiosity.

<head>(iii.) The Faculty-Psychology and its Critics.</head>

<p>
What Herbart (as well as Hegel) finds perpetual
ground for objecting to is the talk about mental faculties.
This objection is part of a general characteristic
of all the higher philosophy; and the recurrence of it
gives an illustration of how hard it is for any class of
men to see themselves as others see them. If there be
anything the vulgar believe to be true of philosophy, it
is that it deals in distant and abstruse generalities, that
it neglects the shades of individuality and reality, and
launches out into unsubstantial general ideas. But it
would be easy to gather from the great thinkers an
anthology of passages in which they hold it forth as the
great work of philosophy to rescue our conceptions
from the indefiniteness and generality of popular conception,
and to give them real, as opposed to a merely
nominal, individuality.
</p>

<p>
The Wolffian school, which Herbart (not less than
Kant) found in possession of the field, and which in
Germany may be taken to represent only a slight
variant of the half-and-half attitude of vulgar thought,
<pb n='lxxiv'/><anchor id='Pglxxiv'/>
was entrenched in the psychology of faculties. Empirical
psychology, said Wolff<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Psychologia Empirica</hi>, § 29.</note>, tells the number and
character of the soul's faculties: rational psychology
will tell what they <q>properly</q> are, and how they subsist
in soul. It is assumed that there are general receptacles
or tendencies of mental operation which in course of
time get filled or qualified in a certain way: and that
when this question is disposed of, it still remains to fix
on the metaphysical bases of these facts.
</p>

<p>
That a doctrine of faculties should fix itself in psychology
is not so wonderful. In the non-psychical
world objects are easily discriminated in space, and the
individual thing lasts through a time. But a phase of
mind is as such fleeting and indeterminate: its individual
features which come from its <q>object</q> tend soon to
vanish in memory: all freshness of definite characters
wears off, and there is left behind only a vague <q>recept</q>
of the one and same in many, a sort of hypostatised
representative, faint but persistent, of what in experience
was an ever-varying succession. We generalise here
as elsewhere: but elsewhere the many singulars remain
to confront us more effectually. But in Mind the
immense variety of real imagination, memory, judgment
is forgotten, and the name in each case reduced to
a meagre abstract. Thus the identity in character and
operation, having been cut off from the changing elements
in its real action, is transmuted into a substantial
somewhat, a subsistent faculty. The relationship of one
to another of the powers thus by abstraction and fancy
created becomes a problem of considerable moment,
their causal relations in particular: till in the end they
stand outside and independent of each other, engaged,
as Herbart says, in a veritable <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>bellum omnium contra
omnes</foreign>.
</p>

<pb n='lxxv'/><anchor id='Pglxxv'/>

<p>
But this hypostatising of faculties becomes a source
of still further difficulties when it is taken in connexion
with the hypostasis of the Soul or Self or Ego. To
Aristotle the Soul in its general aspect is Energy or
Essence; and its individual phases are energies. But
in the hands of the untrained these conceptions came to
be considerably displaced. Essence or Substance came
to be understood (as may be seen in Locke, and still
more in loose talk) as a something,&mdash;a substratum,&mdash;or
peculiar nature&mdash;(of which <emph>in itself</emph> nothing further
could be said<note place='foot'>As is also the case with Herbart's metaphysical reality of the Soul.</note> but which notwithstanding was permanent
and perhaps imperishable): this something
subsistent exhibited certain properties or activities.
There thus arose, on one hand, the Soul-thing,&mdash;a
substance misunderstood and sensualised with a supernatural
sensuousness,&mdash;a denizen of the transcendental
or even of the transcendent world: and, on the other
hand, stood the actual manifestations, the several exhibitions
of this force, the assignable and describable
psychic facts. We are accordingly brought before the
problem of how this one substance or essence stands to
the several entities or hypostases known as faculties.
And we still have in the rear the further problem of
how these abstract entities stand to the real and concrete
single acts and states of soul and mind.
</p>

<p>
This hypostatising of faculties, and this distinction
of the <q>Substantial</q> soul from its <q>accidentia</q> or
phenomena, had grown&mdash;through the materialistic proclivities
of popular conception&mdash;from the indications
found in Aristotle. It attained its climax, perhaps in
the Wolffian school in Germany, but it has been the
resort of superficial psychology in all ages. For while
it, on one hand, seemed to save the substantial Soul on
whose incorruptibility great issues were believed to
<pb n='lxxvi'/><anchor id='Pglxxvi'/>
hinge, it held out, on the other, an open hand to the
experimental inquirer, whom it bade freely to search
amongst the phenomena. But if it was the refuge of
pusillanimity, it was also the perpetual object of censure
from all the greater and bolder spirits. Thus, the
psychology of Hobbes may be hasty and crude, but
it is at least animated by a belief that the mental life
is continuous, and not cut off by abrupt divisions
severing the mental faculties. The <q>image</q> (according
to his materialistically coloured psychology) which,
when it is a strong motion, is called sense, passes,
as it becomes weaker or decays, into imagination, and
gives rise, by its various complications and associations
with others, to reminiscence, experience, expectation.
Similarly, the voluntary motion which is an effect or
a phase of imagination, beginning at first in small
motions&mdash;called by themselves <q>endeavours,</q> and in
relation to their cause <q>appetites</q> or <q>desires<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Human Nature</hi>, vii. 2. <q>Pleasure, Love, and appetite, which is
also called desire, are divers names for divers considerations of the
same thing....</q> Deliberation is (ch. xii. 1) the <q>alternate succession
of appetite and fears.</q></note></q>&mdash;leads
on cumulatively to Will, which is the <q>last appetite in
deliberating.</q> Spinoza, his contemporary, speaks in
the same strain<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Eth.</hi> ii. 48 Schol.</note>. <q>Faculties of intellect, desire, love, &amp;c.,
are either utterly fictitious, or nothing but metaphysical
entities, or universals which we are in the habit of
forming from particulars. Will and intellect are thus
supposed to stand to this or that idea, this or that
volition, in the same way as stoniness to this or that
stone, or as man to Peter or Paul.</q> They are supposed
to be a general something which gets defined and
detached. But, in the mind, or in the cogitant soul,
there are no such things. There are only ideas: and
<pb n='lxxvii'/><anchor id='Pglxxvii'/>
by an <q>idea</q> we are to understand not an image on the
retina or in the brain, not a <q>dumb something, like
a painting on a panel<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Eth.</hi> ii. 43 Schol.: cf. 49 Schol.</note>,</q> but a mode of thinking, or even
the act of intellection itself. The ideas <emph>are</emph> the mind:
mind does not <emph>have</emph> ideas. Further, every <q>idea,</q> as
such, <q>involves affirmation or negation,</q>&mdash;is not an
image, but an act of judgment&mdash;contains, as we should
say, an implicit reference to actuality,&mdash;a reference
which in volition is made explicit. Thus (concludes
the corollary of Eth. ii. 49) <q>Will and Intellect are one
and the same.</q> But in any case the <q>faculties</q> as such
are no better than <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>entia rationis</foreign> (i.e. auxiliary modes of
representing facts).
</p>

<p>
Leibniz speaks no less distinctly and sanely in this
direction. <q>True powers are never mere possibilities:
they are always tendency and action.</q> The <q>Monad</q>&mdash;that
is the quasi-intelligent unit of existence,&mdash;is essentially
activity, and its actions are perceptions and
appetitions, i.e. tendencies to pass from one perceptive
state or act to another. It is out of the variety, the
complication, and relations of these miniature or little
perceptions and appetitions, that the conspicuous phenomena
of consciousness are to be explained, and not by
supposing them due to one or other faculty. The soul
is a unity, a self-developing unity, a unity which at each
stage of its existence shows itself in a perception or
idea,&mdash;each such perception however being, to repeat
the oft quoted phrase, <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>plein de l'avenir et chargé du
passé</foreign>:&mdash;each, in other words, is not stationary, but
active and urgent, a progressive force, as well as a
representative element. Above all, Leibniz has the
view that the soul gives rise to all its ideas from itself:
that its life is its own production, not a mere inheritance
of ideas which it has from birth and nature, nor
<pb n='lxxviii'/><anchor id='Pglxxviii'/>
a mere importation into an empty room from without,
but a necessary result of its own constitution acting in
necessary (predetermined) reciprocity and harmony
with the rest of the universe.
</p>

<p>
But Hobbes, Spinoza, and Leibniz, were most attentively
heard in the passages where they favoured
or combatted the dominant social and theological
prepossessions. Their glimpses of truer insight and
even their palpable contributions in the line of a true
psychology were ignored or forgotten. More attention,
perhaps, was attracted by an attempt of a very different
style. This was the system of Condillac, who, as
Hegel says (p. <ref target='Pg061'>61</ref>), made an unmistakable attempt to
show the necessary interconnexion of the several
modes of mental activity. In his <hi rend='italic'>Traité des Sensations</hi>
(1754), following on his <hi rend='italic'>Essai sur l'origine des
connaissances humaines</hi> (1746), he tried to carry out
systematically the deduction or derivation of all our
ideas from sense, or to trace the filiation of all our
faculties from sensation. Given a mind with no other
power than sensibility, the problem is to show how it
acquires all its other faculties. Let us then suppose
a sentient animal to which is offered a single sensation,
or one sensation standing out above the others. In
such circumstances the sensation <q>becomes</q> (<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>devient</foreign>)
attention: or a sensation <q>is</q> (<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>est</foreign>) attention, either
because it is alone, or because it is more lively than
all the rest. Again: before such a being, let us set
two sensations: to perceive or feel (<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>apercevoir ou sentir</foreign>)
the two sensations is the same thing (<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>c'est la même
chose</foreign>). If one of the sensations is not present, but
a sensation made already, then to perceive it is memory.
Memory, then, is only <q>transformed sensation</q> (<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>sensation
transformée</foreign>). Further, suppose we attend to both
ideas, this is <q>the same thing</q> as to compare them.
<pb n='lxxix'/><anchor id='Pglxxix'/>
And to compare them we must see difference or resemblance.
This is judgment. <q>Thus sensation becomes
successively attention, comparison, judgment.</q> And&mdash;by
further steps of the equating process&mdash;it appears
that sensation again <q>becomes</q> an act of reflection.
And the same may be said of imagination and reasoning:
all are transformed sensations.
</p>

<p>
If this is so with the intelligence, it is equally the
case with the Will. To feel and not feel well or ill
is impossible. Coupling then this feeling of pleasure
or pain with the sensation and its transformations, we
get the series of phases ranging from desire, to passion,
hope, will. <q>Desire is only the action of the same
faculties as are attributed to the understanding.</q> A
lively desire is a passion: a desire, accompanied with
a belief that nothing stands in its way, is a volition.
But combine these affective with the intellectual processes
already noticed, and you have thinking (<foreign rend='italic'>penser</foreign>)<note place='foot'>This wide scope of thinking (<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>cogitatio</foreign>, <foreign rend='italic'>penser</foreign>) is at least as old as
the Cartesian school: and should be kept in view, as against a tendency
to narrow its range to the mere intellect.</note>.
Thus thought in its entirety is, only and always, transformed
sensation.
</p>

<p>
Something not unlike this, though scarcely so simply
and directly doctrinaire, is familiar to us in some
English psychology, notably James Mill's<note place='foot'>e.g. <hi rend='italic'>Analysis of the Human Mind</hi>, ch. xxiv. <q>Attention is but
another name for the interesting character of the idea;</q> ch. xix.
<q>Desire and the idea of a pleasurable sensation are convertible terms.</q></note>. Taken in
their literal baldness, these identifications may sound
strained,&mdash;or trifling. But if we look beyond the
words, we can detect a genuine instinct for maintaining
and displaying the unity and continuity of mental
life through all its modifications,&mdash;coupled unfortunately
with a bias sometimes in favour of reducing higher or
more complex states of mind to a mere prolongation
<pb n='lxxx'/><anchor id='Pglxxx'/>
of lower and beggarly rudiments. But otherwise such
analyses are useful as aids against the tendency of
inert thought to take every name in this department
as a distinguishable reality: the tendency to part will
from thought&mdash;ideas from emotion&mdash;and even imagination
from reason, as if either could be what it professed
without the other.

<div>
<head>(iv.) Methods and Problems of Psychology.</head>

<p>
The difficulties of modern psychology perhaps lie
in other directions, but they are not less worth guarding
against. They proceed mainly from failure or
inability to grasp the central problem of psychology,
and a disposition to let the pen (if it be a book on the
subject) wander freely through the almost illimitable
range of instance, illustration, and application. Though
it is true that the proper study of mankind is man, it is
hardly possible to say what might not be brought under
this head. <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>Homo sum, nihil a me alienum puto</foreign>, it might
be urged. Placed in a sort of middle ground between
physiology (summing up all the results of physical
science) and general history (including the contributions
of all the branches of sociology), the psychologist
need not want for material. He can wander into ethics,
aesthetic, and logic, into epistemology and metaphysics.
And it cannot be said with any conviction that he is
actually trespassing, so long as the ground remains so
ill-fenced and vaguely enclosed. A desultory collection
of observations on traits of character, anecdotes
of mental events, mixed up with hypothetical descriptions
of how a normal human being may be supposed
<pb n='lxxxi'/><anchor id='Pglxxxi'/>
to develop his so-called faculties, and including some
dictionary-like verbal distinctions, may make a not
uninteresting and possibly bulky work entitled Psychology.
</p>

<p>
It is partly a desire of keeping up to date which is
responsible for the copious extracts or abstracts from
treatises on the anatomy and functions of the nerve-system,
which, accompanied perhaps by a diagram of
the brain, often form the opening chapter of a work
on psychology. Even if these researches had achieved
a larger number of authenticated results than they as
yet have, they would only form an appendix and an
illustration to the proper subject<note place='foot'>As Mr. Spencer says (<hi rend='italic'>Psychology</hi>, i. 141), <q>Objective psychology
can have no existence as such without borrowing its data from subjective
psychology.</q></note>. As they stand, and
so long as they remain largely hypothetical, the use of
them in psychology only fosters the common delusion
that, when we can picture out in material outlines a
theory otherwise unsupported, it has gained some
further witness in its favour. It is quite arguable
indeed that it may be useful to cut out a section from
general human biology which should include the parts
of it that were specially interesting in connexion with
the expression or generation of thought, emotion, and
desire. But in that case, there is a blunder in singling
out the brain alone, and especially the organs of sense
and voluntary motion,&mdash;except for the reason that this
province of psycho-physics alone has been fairly mapped
out. The preponderant half of the soul's life is linked
to other parts of the physical system. Emotion and
volition, and the general tone of the train of ideas, if
they are to be connected with their expression and
physical accompaniment (or aspect), would require a
sketch of the heart and lungs, as well as the digestive
<pb n='lxxxii'/><anchor id='Pglxxxii'/>
system in general. Nor these alone. Nerve analysis
(especially confined to the larger system), though most
modern, is not alone important, as Plato and Aristotle
well saw. So that if biology is to be adapted for
psychological use (and if psychology deals with more
than cognitive processes), a liberal amount of physiological
information seems required.
</p>

<p>
Experimental psychology is a term used with a
considerable laxity of content; and so too is that of
physiological psychology, or psycho-physics. And the
laxity mainly arises because there is an uncertainty as
to what is principal and what secondary in the inquiry.
Experiment is obviously a help to observation: and so
far as the latter is practicable, the former would seem
to have a chance of introduction. But in any case,
experiment is only a means to an end and only practicable
under the guidance of hypothesis and theory. Its
main value would be in case the sphere of psychology
were completely paralleled with one province of physiology.
It was long ago maintained by Spinoza and (in
a way by) Leibniz, that there is no mental phenomenon
without its bodily equivalent, pendant, or correspondent.
The <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>ordo rerum</foreign> (the molecular system of movements)
is, he held, the same as the order of ideas. But it is
only at intervals, under special conditions, or when
they reach a certain magnitude, that ideas emerge into
full consciousness. As consciousness presents them,
they are often discontinuous, and abrupt: and they do
not always carry with them their own explanation.
Hence if we are confined to the larger phenomena of
consciousness alone, our science is imperfect: many
things seem anomalous; above all, perhaps, will, attention,
and the like. We have seen how Herbart (partly
following the hints of Leibniz), attempted to get over
this difficulty by the hypothesis of idea-forces which
<pb n='lxxxiii'/><anchor id='Pglxxxiii'/>
generate the forms and matter of consciousness by
their mutual impact and resistance. Physiological
psychology substitutes for Herbart's reals and his
idea-forces a more materialistic sort of reality; perhaps
functions of nerve-cells, or other analogous
entities. There, it hopes one day to discover the
underlying continuity of event which in the upper
range of consciousness is often obscured, and then the
process would be, as the phrase goes, explained: we
should be able to picture it out without a gap.
</p>

<p>
These large hopes may have a certain fulfilment. They
may lead to the withdrawal of some of the fictitious
mental processes which are still described in works of
psychology. But on the whole they can only have
a negative and auxiliary value. The value, that is,
of helping to confute feigned connexions and to suggest
truer. They will be valid against the mode of thought
which, when Psyché fails us for an explanation, turns
to body, and interpolates soul between the states of
body: the mode which, in an older phraseology, jumps
from final causes to physical, and from physical (or
efficient) to final. Here, as elsewhere, the physical
has its place: and here, more than in many places,
the physical has been unfairly treated. But the whole
subject requires a discussion of the so-called <q>relations</q>
of soul and body: a subject on which popular conceptions
and so-called science are radically obscure.
</p>

<p>
<q>But the danger which threatens experimental psychology,</q>
says Münsterberg, <q rend='pre'>is that, in investigating
details, the connexion with questions of principle may
be so lost sight of that the investigation finally lands
at objects scientifically quite worthless<note place='foot'>The same failure to note that experiment is valuable only where
general points of view are defined, is a common fault in biology.</note>. Psychology
<pb n='lxxxiv'/><anchor id='Pglxxxiv'/>
forgets only too easily that all those numerical statistics
which experiment allows us to form are only means for
psychological analysis and interpretation, not ends in
themselves. It piles up numbers and numbers, and
fails to ask whether the results so formed have any
theoretical value whatever: it seeks answers before
a question has been clearly and distinctly framed;
whereas the value of experimental answers always
depends on the exactitude with which the question is
put. Let me remind the reader, how one inquirer after
another made many thousand experiments on the
estimation of small intervals of time, without a single
one of them raising the question what the precise
point was which these experiments sought to measure,
what was the psychological occurrence in the case, or
what psychological phenomena were employed as the
standard of time-intervals. And so each had his own
arbitrary standard of measurement, each of them piled
up mountains of numbers, each demonstrated that his
predecessor was wrong; but neither Estel nor Mehner
have carried the problem of the time-sense a single
step further.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>This must be all changed, if we are not to drift into
the barrenest scholastic.... Everywhere out of the
correct perception that problems of principle demand
the investigation of detailed phenomena, and that the
latter investigation must proceed in comparative
independence of the question of principles, there has
grown the false belief that the description of detail
phenomena is the ultimate aim of science. And so,
side by side with details which are of importance to
principles, we have others, utterly indifferent and
theoretically worthless, treated with the same zeal. To
the solution of their barren problems the old Schoolmen
applied a certain acuteness; but in order to turn out
<pb n='lxxxv'/><anchor id='Pglxxxv'/>
masses of numbers from barren experiments, all that is
needed is a certain insensibility to fits of ennui. Let
numbers be less collected for their own sake: and
instead, let the problems be so brought to a point that
the answers may possess the character of principles.
Let each experiment be founded on far more theoretical
considerations, then the number of the experiments
may be largely diminished<note place='foot'>Münsterberg, <hi rend='italic'>Aufgaben und Methoden der Psychologie</hi>, p. 144.</note>.</q>
</p>

<p>
What is thus said of a special group of inquiries by
one of the foremost of the younger psychologists, is
not without its bearings on all the departments in which
psychology can learn. For physiological, or what is
technically called psychological, experiment, is co-ordinate
with many other sources of information.
Much, for instance, is to be learnt by a careful study
of language by those who combine sound linguistic
knowledge with psychological training. It is in
language, spoken and written, that we find at once
the great instrument and the great document of the
distinctively human progress from a mere <foreign lang='el' rend='italic'>Psyche</foreign> to
a mature <foreign lang='el' rend='italic'>Nous</foreign>, from Soul to Mind. Whether we look
at the varieties of its structure under different ethnological
influences, or at the stages of its growth in a
nation and an individual, we get light from language
on the differentiation and consolidation of ideas. But
here again it is easy to lose oneself in the world of
etymology, or to be carried away into the enticing
questions of real and ideal philology.
</p>

<p>
<q>The human being of the psychologist,</q> says Herbart<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Lehrbuch der Psychologie</hi>, § 54 (2nd ed.), or § 11 (1st ed.).</note>,
<q>is the social and civilised human being who stands on
the apex of the whole history through which his race
has passed. In him is found visibly together all the
multiplicity of elements, which, under the name of
<pb n='lxxxvi'/><anchor id='Pglxxxvi'/>
mental faculties, are regarded as a universal inheritance
of humanity. Whether they are originally in conjunction,
whether they are originally a multiplicity, is a
point on which the facts are silent. The savage and
the new-born child give us far less occasion to admire
the range of their mind than do the nobler animals.
But the psychologists get out of this difficulty by the
unwarranted assumption that all the higher mental
activities exist potentially in children and savages&mdash;though
not in the animals&mdash;as a rudimentary predisposition
or psychical endowment. Of such a nascent
intellect, a nascent reason, and nascent moral sense,
they find recognisable traces in the scanty similarities
which the behaviour of child or savage offers to those of
civilised man. We cannot fail to note that in their
descriptions they have before them a special state of
man, and one which, far from accurately defined, merely
follows the general impression made upon us by those
beings we name civilised. An extremely fluctuating
character inevitably marks this total impression. For
there are no general facts:&mdash;the genuine psychological
documents lie in the momentary states of individuals:
and there is an immeasurably long way from these to
the height of the universal concept of man in general.</q>
</p>

<p>
And yet Man in general,&mdash;Man as man and therefore
as mind&mdash;the concept of Man&mdash;normal and ideal man&mdash;the
complete and adequate Idea of man&mdash;is the true
terminus of the psychological process; and whatever be
the difficulties in the way, it is the only proper goal of
the science. Only it has to be built up, constructed,
evolved, developed,&mdash;and not assumed as a datum of
popular imagination. We want a concept, concrete and
real, of Man and of Mind, which shall give its proper
place to each of the elements that, in the several
examples open to detailed observation, are presented
<pb n='lxxxvii'/><anchor id='Pglxxxvii'/>
with unfair or exaggerated prominence. The savage
and the child are not to be left out as free from
contributing to form the ideal: virtues here are not
more important than vices, and are certainly not likely
to be so informing: even the insane and the idiot show
us what human intelligence is and requires: and the
animals are also within the sweep of psychology. Man
is not its theatre to the exclusion of woman; if it
records the results of introspection of the Me, it will
find vast and copious quarries in the various modes in
which an individual identifies himself with others as
We. And even the social and civilised man gets his
designation, as usual, <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>a potiori</foreign>. He is more civilised
and social than others: perhaps rather more civilised
than not. But always, in some measure, he is at the
same time unsocial or anti-social, and uncivilised.
Each unit in the society of civilisation has to the
outside observer&mdash;and sometimes even to his own
self-detached and impartial survey&mdash;a certain oddity
or fixity, a gleam of irrationality, which shows him to
fall short of complete sanity or limpid and mobile
intelligence. He has not wholly put off the savage,&mdash;least
of all, says the cynic, in his relations with the
other sex. He carries with him even to the grave
some grains of the recklessness and petulance of
childhood. And rarely, if ever, can it be said of him
that he has completely let the ape and tiger die.
</p>

<p>
But that is only one way of looking at the matter&mdash;and
one which, perhaps, is more becoming to the
pathologist and the cynic, than to the psychologist.
Each of these stages of psychical development, even
if that development be obviously describable as degeneration,
has something which, duly adjusted, has its
place and function in the theory of the normally-complete
human mind. The animal, the savage, and
<pb n='lxxxviii'/><anchor id='Pglxxxviii'/>
the child,&mdash;each has its part there. It is a mutilated,
one-sided and superficial advance in socialisation which
cuts off the civilised creature from the natural stem of
his ancestry, from the large freedom, the immense
<emph>insouciance</emph>, the childlikeness of his first estate. There
is something, again, wanting in the man who utterly
lacks the individualising realism and tenderness of the
woman, as in the woman who can show no comprehension
of view or bravery of enterprise. Even pathological
states of mind are not mere anomalies and mere
degenerations. Nature perhaps knows no proper
degenerations, but only by-ways and intricacies in the
course of development. Still less is the vast enormity
or irregularity of genius to be ignored. It is all&mdash;to
the philosophic mind&mdash;a question of degree and proportion,&mdash;though
often the proportion seems to exceed
the scale of our customary denominators. If an
element is latent or quiescent (in arrest), that is no
index to its absolute amount: <q>we know not what's
resisted.</q> Let us by all means keep proudly to our
happy mediocrity of faculty, and step clear of insanity
or idiotcy on one hand, and from genius or heroism on
the other. But the careful observer will notwithstanding
note how delicately graded and how intricately
combined are the steps which connect extremes
so terribly disparate. It is only vulgar ignorance which
turns away in hostility or contempt from the imbecile
and the deranged, and only a worse than vulgar
sciolism which sees in genius and the hero nothing
but an aberration from its much-prized average.
Criminalistic anthropology, or the psychology of the
criminal, may have indulged in much frantic exaggeration
as to the doom which nature and heredity have
pronounced over the fruit of the womb even before it
entered the shores of light: yet they have at least
<pb n='lxxxix'/><anchor id='Pglxxxix'/>
served to discredit the free and easy assumption of the
abstract averagist, and shown how little the penalties
of an unbending law meet the requirements of social
well-being.
</p>

<p>
Yet, if psychology be willing to learn in all these and
other provinces of the estate of man, it must remember
that, once it goes beyond the narrow range in which the
interpretations of symbol and expression have become
familiar, it is constantly liable to blunder in the inevitable
effort to translate observation into theory. The
happy mean between making too much of palpable
differences and hurrying on to a similar rendering of
similar signs is the rarest of gifts. Or, perhaps, it were
truer to say it is the latest and most hardly won of
acquirements. To learn to observe&mdash;observe with mind&mdash;is
not a small thing. There are rules for it&mdash;both rules
of general scope and, above all, rules in each special
department. But like all <q>major premisses</q> in practice,
everything depends on the power of judgment, the tact,
the skill, the <q>gift</q> of applying them. They work not
as mere rules to be conned by rote, but as principles
assimilated into constituents of the mental life-blood:
rules which serve only as condensed reminders and
hints of habits of thought and methods of research
which have grown up in action and reflection. To
observe we must comprehend: yet we can only
comprehend by observing. We all know how unintelligible&mdash;save
for epochs of ampler reciprocity, and
it may be even of acquired unity of interest&mdash;the two
sexes are for each other. Parents can remember how
mysteriously minded they found their own elders; and
in most cases they have to experience the depth of the
gulf which in certain directions parts them from their
children's hearts. Even in civilised Europe, the
ordinary member of each nation has an underlying
<pb n='xc'/><anchor id='Pgxc'/>
conviction (which at moments of passion or surprise
will rise and find harsh utterance) that the foreigner is
queer, irrational, and absurd. If the foreigner, further,
be so far removed as a Chinaman (or an Australian
<q>black</q>), there is hardly anything too vile, meaningless,
or inhuman which the European will not readily believe
in the case of one who, it may be, in turn describes him
as a <q>foreign devil.</q> It can only be in a fit of noble
chivalry that the British rank and file can so far
temporise with its insular prejudice as to admit of
<q>Fuzzy-wuzzy</q> that
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<q>He's a poor benighted 'eathen&mdash;but a first-class fightin' man.</q>
</quote>

<p>
Not every one is an observer who chooses to dub
himself so, nor is it in a short lapse of time and with
condescension for foreign habits, that any observer
whatever can become a trustworthy reporter of the
ideas some barbarian tribe holds concerning the things
of earth and air, and the hidden things of spirits and
gods. The <q>interviewer</q> no doubt is a useful being
when it is necessary to find <q>copy,</q> or when sharp-drawn
characters and picturesque incidents are needed
to stimulate an inert public, ever open to be interested
in some new thing. But he is a poor contributor to
the stored materials of science.
</p>

<p>
It is of other stuff that true science is made. And if
even years of nominal intercourse and spatial juxtaposition
sometimes leave human beings, as regards
their inner selves, in the position of strangers still,
what shall be said of the attempt to discern the psychic
life of animals? Will the touch of curiosity which
prompts us to watch the proceedings of the strange
creatures,&mdash;will a course of experimentation on their
behaviour under artificial conditions,&mdash;justify us in
drawing liberal conclusions as to why they so behaved,
<pb n='xci'/><anchor id='Pgxci'/>
and what they thought and felt about it? It is necessary
in the first place to know what to observe, and
how, and above all what for. But that presumed, we
must further live with the animals not only as their
masters and their examiners, but as their friends and
fellow-creatures; we must be able&mdash;and so lightly that
no effort is discernable&mdash;to lay aside the burden and
garb of civilisation; we must possess that stamp of
sympathy and similarity which invites confidence, and
breaks down the reserve which our poor relations,
whether human or others, offer to the first approaches
of a strange superior. It is probable that in that case
we should have less occasion to wonder at their oddities
or to admire their sagacity. But a higher and more
philosophical wonder might, as in other cases when we
get inside the heart of our subject, take the place of the
cheap and childish love of marvels, or of the vulgar
straining after comic traits.
</p>

<p>
Of all this mass of materials the psychologist proper
can directly make only a sparing use. Even as illustrations,
his data must not be presented too often in all
their crude and undigested individuality, or he runs
the risk of leaving one-sided impressions. Every single
instance, individualised and historical,&mdash;unless it be
exhibited by that true art of genius which we cannot
expect in the average psychologist&mdash;narrows, even
though it be but slightly, the complete and all-sided
truth. Anecdotes are good, and to the wise they convey
a world of meaning, but to lesser minds they sometimes
suggest anything but the points they should accentuate.
Without the detail of individual realistic study there is
no psychology worth the name. History, story, we must
have: but at the same time, with the philosopher, we
must say, I don't give much weight to stories. And
this is what will always&mdash;except in rare instances where
<pb n='xcii'/><anchor id='Pgxcii'/>
something like genius is conjoined with it&mdash;make esoteric
science hard and unpopular. It dare not&mdash;if it is true
to its idea&mdash;rest on any amount of mere instances, as
isolated, unreduced facts. Yet it can only have real
power so far as it concentrates into itself the life-blood
of many instances, and indeed extracts the pith and
unity of all instances.
</p>

<p>
Nor, on the other hand, can it turn itself too directly
and intently towards practical applications. All this
theory of mental progress from the animate soul to the
fullness of religion and science deals solely with the
universal process of education: <q>the education of
humanity</q> we may call it: the way in which mind
is made true and real<note place='foot'>See p. <ref target='Pg011'>11</ref> (§ 387).</note>. It is therefore a question of
intricacy and of time how to carry over this general
theory into the arena of education as artificially
directed and planned. To try to do so at a single
step would be to repeat the mistake of Plato, if Plato
may be taken to suppose (which seems incredible) that
a theoretical study of the dialectics of truth and goodness
would enable his rulers, without the training of
special experience, to undertake the supreme tasks of
legislation or administration. All politics, like all
education, rests on these principles of the means and
conditions of mental growth: but the schooling of
concrete life, though it may not develop the faculty
of formulating general laws, will often train better for
the management of the relative than a mere logical
Scholastic in first or absolute principles.
</p>

<p>
In conclusion, there are one or two points which
seem of cardinal importance for the progress of psychology.
(1) Its difference from the physical sciences has
to be set out: in other words, the peculiarity of psychical
fact. It will not do merely to say that experience marks
<pb n='xciii'/><anchor id='Pgxciii'/>
out these boundaries with sufficient clearness. On the
contrary, the terms consciousness, feeling, mind, &amp;c.,
are evidently to many psychologists mere names. In
particular, the habits of physical research when introduced
into mental study lead to a good deal of what
can only be called mythology. (2) There should be a
clearer recognition of the problem of the relations of
mental unity to mental elements. But to get that, a more
thorough logical and metaphysical preparation is needed
than is usually supposed necessary. The doctrine of
identity and necessity, of universal and individual, has
to be faced, however tedious. (3) The distinction between
first-grade and second-grade elements and factors in the
mental life has to be realised. The mere idea as presentative
or immediate has to be kept clear of the more
logico-reflective, or normative ideas, which belong to
judgment and reasoning. And the number of these
grades in mental development seems endless. (4) But,
also, a separation is required&mdash;were it but temporary&mdash;between
what may be called principles, and what is
detail. At present, in psychology, <q>principles</q> is a
word almost without meaning. A complete all-explaining
system is of course impossible at present and
may always be so. Yet if an effort of thought could be
concentrated on cardinal issues, and less padding of
conventional and traditional detail were foisted in, much
might thereby be done to make detailed research fruitful.
(5) And finally, perhaps, if psychology be a philosophical
study, some hint as to its purpose and problem
would be desirable. If it is only an abstract branch of
science, of course, no such hint is in place.

<head>Essay III. On Some Psychological Aspects Of Ethics.</head>

<p>
Allusion has already been made to the question of
the boundaries between logic and psychology, between
logic and ethics, ethics and psychology, and psychology
and epistemology. Each of these occasionally comes to
cover ground that seems more appropriate to the others.
Logic is sometimes restricted to denote the study of the
conditions of derivative knowledge, of the canons of
inference and the modes of proof. If taken more
widely as the science of thought-form, it is supposed
to imply a world of fixed or stereotyped relations
between ideas, a system of stable thoughts governed
by inflexible laws in an absolute order of immemorial
or eternal truth. As against such fixity, psychology is
supposed to deal with these same ideas as products&mdash;as
growing out of a living process of thought&mdash;having a
history behind them and perhaps a prospect of further
change. The genesis so given may be either a mere
chronicle-history, or it may be a philosophical development.
In the former case, it would note the occasions
of incident and circumstance, the reactions of mind and
environment, under which the ideas were formed. Such
<pb n='xcv'/><anchor id='Pgxcv'/>
a psychological genesis of several ideas is found in the
Second Book of Locke's Essay. In the latter case,
the account would be more concerned with the inner
movement, the action and reaction in ideas themselves,
considered not as due to casual occurrences, but as
self-developing by an organic growth. But in either
case, ideas would be shown not to be ready-made and
independently existing kinds in a world of idea-things,
and not to form an unchanging diagram or framework,
but to be a growth, to have a history, and a development.
Psychology in this sense would be a dynamical,
as opposed to the supposed statical, treatment of ideas
and concepts in logic. But it may be doubted how far it
is well to call this psychology: unless psychology deals
with the contents of the mental life, in their meaning
and purpose, instead of, as seems proper, merely in their
character of psychic events. Such psychology is rather
an evolutionist logic,&mdash;a dialectic process more than an
analytic of a datum.
</p>

<p>
In the same way, ethics may be brought into one kind
of contact with psychology. Ethics, like logic, may be
supposed to presuppose and to deal with a certain inflexible
scheme of requirements, a world of moral order
governed by invariable or universal law; an eternal
kingdom of right, existing independently of human
wills, but to be learned and followed out in uncompromising
obedience. As against this supposed
absolute order, psychology may be said to show the
genesis of the idea of obligation and duty, the growth
of the authority of conscience, the formation of ideals,
the relativity of moral ideas. Here also it may reach
this conclusion, by a more external or a more internal
mode of argument. It may try to show, in other words,
that circumstances give rise to these forms of estimating
conduct, or it may argue that they are a necessary
<pb n='xcvi'/><anchor id='Pgxcvi'/>
development in the human being, constituted as he is.
It may again be doubted whether this is properly called
psychology. Yet its purport seems ultimately to be
that the objective order is misconceived when it is
regarded as an external or quasi-physical order: as a
law written up and sanctioned with an external authority&mdash;as,
in Kant's words, a heteronomy. If that order is
objective, it is so because it is also in a sense subjective:
if it is above the mere individuality of the individual, it
is still in a way identical with his true or universal self-hood.
Thus <q>psychological</q> here means the recognition
that the logical and the moral law is an autonomy: that
it is not given, but though necessary, necessary by the
inward movement of the mind. The metaphor of law
is, in brief, misleading. For, according to a common,
though probably an erroneous, analysis of that term, the
essence of a law in the political sphere is to be a species
of command. And that is rather a one-sidedly practical
or aesthetic way of looking at it. The essence of law
in general, and the precondition of every law in special,
is rather uniformity and universality, self-consistency
and absence of contradiction: or, in other words,
rationality. Its essential opposite&mdash;or its contradiction
in essence&mdash;is a privilege, an attempt at isolating a case
from others. It need not indeed always require bare
uniformity&mdash;require i.e. the same act to be done by
different people: but it must always require that every
thing within its operation shall be treated on principles
of utter and thorough harmony and consistency. It
requires each thing to be treated on public principles
and with publicity: nothing apart and mere singular, as
a mere incident or as a world by itself. Differently it
may be treated, but always on grounds of common well-being,
as part of an embracing system.
</p>

<p>
There is probably another sense, however, in which
<pb n='xcvii'/><anchor id='Pgxcvii'/>
psychology comes into close relation with ethics. If
we look on man as a microcosm, his inner system will
more or less reproduce the system of the larger world.
The older psychology used to distinguish an upper or
superior order of faculties from a lower or inferior.
Thus in the intellectual sphere, the intellect, judgment,
and reason were set above the senses, imagination, and
memory. Among the active powers, reasonable will,
practical reason and conscience were ranked as paramount
over the appetites and desires and emotions.
And this use of the word <q>faculty</q> is as old as Plato,
who regards science as a superior faculty to opinion
or imagination. But this application&mdash;which seems a
perfectly legitimate one&mdash;does not, in the first instance,
belong to psychology at all. No doubt it is psychically
presented: but it has an other source. It springs from
an appreciation, a judgment of the comparative truth
or reality of what the so-called psychical act means or
expresses. Such faculties are powers in a hierarchy
of means and ends and presuppose a normative or
critical function which has classified reality. Psychically,
the elements which enter into knowledge are
not other than those which belong to opinion: but
they are nearer an adequate rendering of reality,
they are truer, or nearer the Idea. And in the main
we may say, that is truer or more real which succeeds
in more completely organising and unifying elements&mdash;which
rises more and more above the selfish or isolated
part into the thorough unity of all parts.
</p>

<p>
The superior faculty is therefore the more thorough
organisation of that which is elsewhere less harmoniously
systematised. Opinion is fragmentary and partial: it
begins abruptly and casually from the unknown, and
runs off no less abruptly into the unknown. Knowledge,
on the contrary, is unified: and its unity gives it its
<pb n='xcviii'/><anchor id='Pgxcviii'/>
strength and superiority. The powers which thus exist
are the subjective counterparts of objectively valuable
products. Thus, reason is the subjective counterpart of
a world in which all the constituents are harmonised
and fall into due relationship. It is a product or result,
which is not psychologically, but logically or morally
important. It is a faculty, because it means that actually
its possessor has ordered and systematised his life or
his ideas of things. Psychologically, it, like unreason,
is a compound of elements: but in the case of reason
the composition is unendingly and infinitely consistent;
it is knowledge completely unified. The distinction
then is not in the strictest sense psychological: for it
has an aesthetic or normative character; it is logical or
ethical: it denotes that the idea or the act is an approach
to truth or goodness. And so, when Butler or Plato
distinguishes reason or reflection from appetites and
affections, and even from self-love or from the heart
which loves and hates, this is not exactly a psychological
division in the narrower sense. That is to say: these
are, in Plato's words, not merely <q>parts,</q> but quite as
much <q>kinds</q> and <q>forms</q> of soul. They denote
degrees in that harmonisation of mind and soul which
reproduces the permanent and complete truth of things.
For example, self-love, as Butler describes it, has but
a partial and narrowed view of the worth of acts: it is
engrossing and self-involved: it cannot take in the full
dependence of the narrower interest on the larger and
eternal self. So, in Plato, the man of heart is but
a nature which by fits and starts, or with steady but
limited vision, realises the larger life. These parts or
kinds are not separate and co-existent faculties: but
grades in the co-ordination and unification of the same
one human nature.

<div>
<head>(i.) Psychology and Epistemology.</head>

<p>
Psychology however in the strict sense is extremely
difficult to define. Those who describe it as the
<q>science of mind,</q> the <q>phenomenology of consciousness,</q>
seem to give it a wider scope than they really
mean. The psychologist of the straiter sect tends, on
the other hand, to carry us beyond mind and consciousness
altogether. His, it has been said, is a psychology
without a Psyché. For him Mind, Soul, and Consciousness
are only current and convenient names to designate
the field, the ground on which the phenomena
he observes are supposed to transact themselves. But
they must not on any account interfere with the
operations; any more than Nature in general may
interfere with strictly physical inquiries, or Life and
vital force with the theories of biology. The so-called
Mind is only to be regarded as a stage on which certain
events represent themselves. In this field, or on this
stage, there are certain relatively ultimate elements,
variously called ideas, presentations, feelings, or states
of consciousness. But these elements, though called
ideas, must not be supposed more than mechanical or
dynamical elements; consciousness is rather their product,
a product which presupposes certain operations
and relations between them. If we are to be strictly
scientific, we must, it is urged, treat the factors of
consciousness as not themselves conscious: we must
regard them as quasi-objective, or in abstraction from
the consciousness which surveys them. The Ego must
sink into a mere receptacle or arena of psychic event;
its independent meaning or purport is to be ignored,
as beside the question.
</p>

<p>
When this line is once fixed upon, it seems inevitable
to go farther. Comte was inclined to treat psychology
<pb n='c'/><anchor id='Pgc'/>
as falling between two stools: it must, he thought,
draw all its content either from physiology on the one
hand, or from social factors on the other. The dominant
or experimental psychology of the present day seems
inclined, without however formulating any very definite
statement, to pronounce for the former alternative. It
does not indeed adopt the materialistic view that mind
is only a function of matter. Its standpoint rather is
that the psychical presents itself even to unskilled
observation as dependent on (i.e. not independent of) or
as concomitant with certain physical or corporeal facts.
It adds that the more accurately trained the observer
becomes, the more he comes to discover a corporeal
aspect even where originally he had not surmised its
existence, and to conclude that the two cycles of
psychical and physical event never interfere with each
other: that soul does not intervene in bodily process,
nor body take up and carry on psychical. If it is said
that the will moves the limbs, he replies that the will
which moves is really certain formerly unnoticed movements
of nerve and muscle which are felt or interpreted
as a discharge of power. If the ocular impression is
said to cause an impression on the mind, he replies that
any fact hidden under that phrase refers to a change in
the molecules of the brain. He will therefore conclude
that for the study of psychical phenomena the physical
basis, as it may be called, is all important. Only so
can observation really deal with fact capable of description
and measurement. Thus psychology, it may be
said, tends to become a department of physiology.
From another standpoint, biology may be said to receive
its completion in psychology. How much either phrase
means, however, will depend on the estimate we form
of biology. If biology is only the study of mechanical
and chemical phenomena on the peculiar field known as
<pb n='ci'/><anchor id='Pgci'/>
an organism, and if that organism is only treated as an
environment which may be ignored, then psychology,
put on the same level, is not the full science of mind,
any more than the other is the full study of life. They
both have narrowed their subject to suit the abstract
scheme of the laboratory, where the victim of experiment
is either altered by mutilation and artificial restrictions,
or is dead. If, on the contrary, biology has a substantial
unity of its own to which mechanical and
chemical considerations are subordinate and instrumental,
psychology may even take part with physiology
without losing its essential rank. But in that case, we
must, as Spinoza said<note place='foot'>Cf. Nietzsche, <hi rend='italic'>Also sprach Zarathustra</hi>, i. 43. <q>There is more
reason in thy body than in thy best wisdom.</q></note>, think less mechanically of the
animal frame, and recognise (after the example of
Schelling) something truly inward (i.e. not merely
locally inside the skin) as the supreme phase or
characteristic of life. We must, in short, recognise
sensibility as the culmination of the physiological and
the beginning of the psychological.
</p>

<p>
To the strictly scientific psychologist, as has been
noted&mdash;or to the psychology which imitates optical and
electrical science&mdash;ideas are only psychical events: they
are not ideas <emph>of</emph> anything, relative, i.e. to something else;
they have no meaning, and no reference to a reality
beyond themselves. They are presentations;&mdash;not
representations of something outside consciousness.
They are appearances: but not appearances of something:
they do not reveal anything beyond themselves.
They are, we may almost say, a unique kind of physical
phenomena. If we say they are presentations of something,
we only mean that in the presented something,
in the felt something, the wished something, we separate
the quality or form or aspect of presentativeness, of
<pb n='cii'/><anchor id='Pgcii'/>
feltness, of wishedness, and consider this aspect by
itself. There are grades, relations, complications, of
such presentations or in such presentedness: and with
the description and explanation of these, psychology is
concerned. They are fainter or stronger, more or less
correlated and antithetical. Presentation (or ideation),
in short, is the name of a train of event, which has its
peculiarities, its laws, its systems, its history.
</p>

<p>
All reality, it may be said, subsists in such presentation;
it is for a consciousness, or in a consciousness. All
<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>esse</foreign>, in its widest sense, is <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>percipi</foreign>. And yet, it seems but
the commonest of experiences to say that all that is
presented is not reality. It <emph>is</emph>, it has a sort of being,&mdash;is
somehow presumed to exist: but it is not reality. And
this reference and antithesis to <emph>what</emph> is presented is
implied in all such terms as <q>ideas,</q> <q>feelings,</q> <q>states of
consciousness</q>: they are distinguished from and related
to objects of sense or external facts, to something, as it
is called, outside consciousness. Thoughts and ideas
are set against things and realities. In their primitive
stage both the child and the savage seem to recognise
no such difference. What they imagine is, as we might
say, on the same plane with what they touch and feel.
They do not, as we reproachfully remark, recognise the
difference between fact and fiction. All of us indeed
are liable to lapses into the same condition. A strong
passion, a keen hope or fear, as we say, invests its
objects with reality: even a sanguine moment presents
as fact what calmer reflection disallows as fancy.
With natural and sane intelligences, however, the
recrudescence of barbarous imagination is soon dispelled,
and the difference between hallucinations and
realities is established. With the utterly wrecked in
mind, the reality of hallucinations becomes a permanent
or habitual state. With the child and the untrained it
<pb n='ciii'/><anchor id='Pgciii'/>
is a recurrent and a disturbing influence: and it need
hardly be added that the circle of these <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>decepti deceptores</foreign>&mdash;people
with the <q>lie in the Soul</q>&mdash;is a large one.
There thus emerges a distinction of vast importance,
that of truth and falsehood, of reality and unreality, or
between representation and reality. There arise two
worlds, the world of ideas, and the world of reality
which it is supposed to represent, and, in many cases, to
represent badly.
</p>

<p>
With this distinction we are brought across the
problem sometimes called Epistemological. Strictly
speaking, it is really part of a larger problem: the
problem of what&mdash;if Greek compounds must be used&mdash;may
be styled Aletheiology&mdash;the theory of truth and
reality: what Hegel called Logic, and what many
others have called Metaphysics. As it is ordinarily
taken up, <q>ideas</q> are believed to be something <emph>in us</emph> which
is representative or symbolical of something truly real
<emph>outside us</emph>. This inward something is said to be the
first and immediate object of knowledge<note place='foot'>This language is very characteristic of the physicists who dabble
in psychology and imagine they are treading in the steps of Kant, if
not even verifying what they call his guesswork: cf. Ziehen, <hi rend='italic'>Physiol.
Psychologie</hi>, 2nd ed. p. 212. <q>In every case there is given us only
the psychical series of sensations and their memory-images, and it is
only a universal hypothesis if we assume beside this psychical series
a material series standing in causal relation to it.... The material
series is not given equally originally with the psychical.</q></note>, and gives us&mdash;in
a mysterious way we need not here discuss&mdash;the
mediate knowledge of the reality, which is sometimes
said to cause it. Ideas in the Mind, or in the Subject,
or in us, bear witness to something outside the mind,&mdash;trans-subjective&mdash;beyond
us. The Mind, Subject, or
Ego, in this parallelism is evidently in some way identified
with our corporeal organism: perhaps even located,
and provided with a <q>seat,</q> in some defined space of that
<pb n='civ'/><anchor id='Pgciv'/>
organism. It is, however, the starting-point of the
whole distinction that ideas <emph>do not</emph>, no less than they
do, conform or correspond to this supra-conscious or
extra-conscious world of real things. Truth or falsehood
arises, according to these assumptions, according
as psychical image or idea corresponds or not to physical
fact. But how, unless by some miraculous second-sight,
where the supreme consciousness, directly contemplating
by intuition the true and independent reality,
turns to compare with this immediate vision the results
of the mediate processes conducted along the organs of
sense,&mdash;how this agreement or disagreement of copy
and original, of idea and reality, can be detected, it is
impossible to say.
</p>

<p>
As has been already noted, the mischief lies in the
hypostatisation of ideas as something existing in abstraction
from things&mdash;and, of things, in abstraction from
ideas. They are two abstractions, the first by the
realist, the second by the idealist called subjective and
psychological. To the realist, things exist by themselves,
and they manage to produce a copy of
themselves (more or less exact, or symbolical) in <emph>our</emph>
mind, i.e. in a materialistically-spiritual or a spiritualistically-material
locus which holds <q>images</q> and ideas.
To the psychological idealist, ideas have a substantive
and primary right to existence, them alone do we really
know, and from them we more or less legitimately are
said (but probably no one takes this seriously) to infer
or postulate a world of permanent things. Now ideas
have no substantive existence as a sort of things, or
even images of things anywhere. All this is pure
mythology. It is said by comparative mythologists that
in some cases the epithet or quality of some deity has
been substantialised (hypostatised) into a separate god,
who, however (so still to keep up the unity), is regarded
<pb n='cv'/><anchor id='Pgcv'/>
as a relative, a son, or daughter, of the original. So the
phrase <q>ideas of things</q> has been taken literally as if it
was double. But to have an idea of a thing merely
means that we know it, or think it. An idea is not
given: it is a thing which is given in the idea. An
idea is not an additional and intervening object of our
knowledge or supposed knowledge. That a thing is
our object of thought is another word for its being our
idea, and that means we know it.
</p>

<p>
The distinction between truth and falsehood, between
reality and appearance, is not arrived at by comparing
what we have before us in our mind with some inaccessible
reality beyond. It is a distinction that grows
up with the growth and organisation of our presentations&mdash;with
their gradual systematisation and unification in
one consciousness. But this consciousness which thinks,
i.e. judges and reasons, is something superior to the
contrast of physical and psychical: superior, i.e. in so
far as it includes and surveys the antithesis, without
superseding it. It is the <q>transcendental unity of
consciousness</q> of Kant&mdash;his synthetic unity of apperception.
It means that all ideas ultimately derive their
reality from their coherence with each other in an all-embracing
or infinite idea. Real in a sense ideas
always are, but with an imperfect reality. Thus the
education to truth is not&mdash;such a thing would be meaningless&mdash;ended
by a rough and ready recommendation
to compare our ideas with facts: it must teach the art
which discovers facts. And the teaching may have to
go through many grades or provinces: in each of which
it is possible to acquire a certain virtuosoship without
being necessarily an adept in another. It is through
what is called the development of intellect, judgment,
and reasoning that the faculty of truth-detecting or
truth-selecting comes. And the common feature of all
<pb n='cvi'/><anchor id='Pgcvi'/>
of these is, so to say, their superiority to the psychological
mechanism, not in the sense of working without
it and directly, but of being the organising unity or
unifier and controller and judge of that mechanism.
The certainty and necessity of truth and knowledge do
not come from a constraint from the external thing
which forces the inner idea into submission; they come
from the inner necessity of conformity and coherence
in the organism of experience. We in fact had better
speak of ideas as experience&mdash;as felt reality: a reality
however which has its degrees and perhaps even its
provinces. All truth comes with the reasoned judgment,
i.e. the syllogism&mdash;i.e. with the institution or discovery
of relations of fact or element to fact or element,
immediate or derivative, partial and less partial, up to
its ideal coherence in one Idea. It is because this
coherence is so imperfectly established in many human
beings that their knowledge is so indistinguishable from
opinion, and that they separate so loosely truth from
error. They have not worked their way into a definitely
articulated system, where there are no gaps, no abrupt
transitions: their mental order is so loosely put together
that divergences and contradictions which vex another
drop off ineffectual from them.

<div>
<head>(ii.) Kant, Fichte, and Hegel.</head>

<p>
This was the idealism which Kant taught and Fichte
promoted. Of the other idealism there are no doubt
abundant traces in the language of Kant: and they
were greedily fastened on by Schopenhauer. To him
the doctrine, that the world is my idea, is adequately
represented when it is translated into the phrase that
<pb n='cvii'/><anchor id='Pgcvii'/>
the world is a phantasmagoria of my brain; and escape
from the subjective idealism thus initiated is found by
him only through a supposed revelation of immediate
being communicated in the experience of will. But
according to the more consistently interpreted Kant,
the problem of philosophy consists in laying bare the
supreme law or conditions of consciousness on which
depend the validity of our knowledge, our estimates of
conduct, and our aesthetic standards. And these roots
of reality are for Kant in the mind&mdash;or, should we
rather say&mdash;in mind&mdash;in <q>Consciousness in General.</q>
In the <hi rend='italic'>Criticism of Pure Reason</hi> the general drift of
his examination is to show that the great things or
final realities which are popularly supposed to stand
in self-subsistent being, as ultimate and all-comprehensive
objects set up for knowledge, are not <q>things</q>
as popularly supposed, but imperative and inevitable
ideas. They are not objects to be known&mdash;(these are
always finite): but rather the unification, the basis, or
condition, and the completion of all knowledge. To
know them&mdash;in the ordinary petty sense of knowledge&mdash;is
as absurd and impossible as it would be, in the
Platonic scheme of reality, to know the idea of good
which is <q>on the further side of knowledge and being.</q>
God and the Soul&mdash;and the same would be true of the
World (though modern speculators sometimes talk as
if they had it at least within their grasp)&mdash;are not mere
<emph>objects</emph> of knowledge. It would be truer to say they are
that by which we know, and they are what in us knows:
they make knowledge possible, and actual. Kant has
sometimes spoken of them as the objects of a faith of
reason. What he means is that reason only issues in
knowledge because of and through this inevitable law
of reason bidding us go on for ever in our search,
because there can be nothing isolated and nowhere
<pb n='cviii'/><anchor id='Pgcviii'/>
any <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>ne plus ultra</foreign> in science, which is infinite and yet
only justified as it postulates or commands unity.
</p>

<p>
Kant's central idea is that truth, beauty, goodness,
are not dependent on some qualities of the object, but
on the universal nature or law of consciousness. Beauty
is not an attribute of things in their abstractness: but
of things as ideas of a subject, and depends on the
proportion and symmetry in the play of human faculty.
Goodness is not conformity to an outward law, but is
obligatory on us through that higher nature which is
our truer being. Truth is not conformity of ideas with
supposed trans-subjective things, but coherence and
stability in the system of ideas. The really infinite
world is not out there, but in here&mdash;in consciousness
in general, which is the denial of all limitation, of all
finality, of all isolation. God is the essential and
inherent unity and unifier of spirit and nature&mdash;the
surety that the world in all its differentiations is one.
The Soul is not an essential entity, but the infinite
fruitfulness and freshness of mental life, which forbids
us stopping at anything short of complete continuity and
unity. The Kingdom of God&mdash;the Soul&mdash;the moral law&mdash;is
within us: within us, as supreme, supra-personal
and infinite intelligences, even amid all our littleness
and finitude. Even happiness which we stretch our
arms after is not really beyond us, but is the essential
self which indeed we can only reach in detail. It is so
both in knowledge and in action. Each knowledge and
enjoyment in reality is limited and partial, but it is made
stable, and it gets a touch of infinitude, by the larger idea
which it helps to realise. Only indeed in that antithesis
between the finite and the infinite does the real live.
Every piece of knowledge is real, only because it
assumes <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>pro tempore</foreign> certain premisses which are given:
every actual beauty is set in some defect of aesthetic
<pb n='cix'/><anchor id='Pgcix'/>
completeness: every actually good deed has to get its
foil in surrounding badness. The real is always partial
and incomplete. But it has the basis or condition of its
reality in an idea&mdash;in a transcendental unity of consciousness,
which is so to say a law, or a system and an
order, which imposes upon it the condition of conformity
and coherence; but a conformity which is essential and
implicit in it.
</p>

<p>
Fichte has called his system a <foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Wissenschaftslehre</foreign>&mdash;a
theory of knowledge. Modern German used the word
<foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Wissenschaft</foreign>, as modern English uses the word Science,
to denote the certified knowledge of piecemeal fact, the
partial unification of elements still kept asunder. But
by <foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Wissen</foreign>, as opposed to <foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Erkennen</foreign>, is meant the I know,
am aware and sure, am in contact with reality, as opposed
to the derivative and conditional reference of something
to something else which explains it. The former is a
wider term: it denotes all consciousness of objective
truth, the certainty which claims to be necessary and
universal, which pledges its whole self for its assertion.
Fichte thus unifies and accentuates the common element
in the Kantian criticisms. In the first of these Kant
had begun by explaining the nature and limitation of
empirical science. It was essentially conditioned by
the given sensation&mdash;dependent i.e. on an unexplained
and preliminary element. This is what makes it science
in the strict or narrow sense of the term: its being set,
as it were, in the unknown, the felt, the sense-datum.
The side of reality is thus the side of limitation and of
presupposition. But what makes it truth and knowledge
in general, on the other hand,&mdash;as distinct from <emph>a</emph> truth
(i.e. partial truth) and a knowledge,&mdash;is the ideal element&mdash;the
mathematical, the logical, the rational law,&mdash;or in
one word, the universal and formal character. So too
every real action is on one hand the product of an
<pb n='cx'/><anchor id='Pgcx'/>
impulse, a dark, merely given, immediate tendency to
be, and without that would be nothing: but on the other
hand it is only an intelligent and moral action in so far
as it has its constitution from an intelligence, a formal
system, which determine its place and function.
</p>

<p>
It is on the latter or ideal element that Kant makes
the emphasis increasingly turn. Not truths, duties,
beauties, but truth, duty, beauty, form his theme. The
formal element&mdash;the logical or epistemological condition
of knowledge and morality and of beauty&mdash;is what he
(and still more Fichte) considers the prime question
of fundamental philosophy. His philosophy is an
attempt to get at the organism of our fundamental
belief&mdash;the construction, from the very base, of our
conception of reality, of our primary certainty. In
technical language, he describes our essential nature as
a Subject-object. It is the unity of an I am which is
also I know that I am: an I will which is also I am
conscious of my will<note place='foot'>It is the same radical feature of consciousness which is thus
noted by Mr. Spencer, <hi rend='italic'>Psychology</hi>, i. 475. <q>Perception and sensation
are ever tending to exclude each other but never succeed.</q> <q>Cognition
and feeling are antithetical and inseparable.</q> <q>Consciousness
continues only in virtue of this conflict.</q> Cf. Plato's resolution in
the <hi rend='italic'>Philebus</hi> of the contest between intelligence and feeling (pleasure).</note>. Here there is a radical disunion
and a supersession of that disunion. Action and contemplation
are continually outrunning each other. The
I will rests upon one I know, and works up to another:
the I know reflects upon an I will, and includes it as
an element in its idea.
</p>

<p>
Kant had brought into use the term Deduction, and
Fichte follows him. The term leads to some confusion:
for in English, by its modern antithesis to induction,
it suggests <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>a priori</foreign> methods in all their iniquity. It
means a kind of jugglery which brings an endless series
<pb n='cxi'/><anchor id='Pgcxi'/>
out of one small term. Kant has explained that he
uses it in the lawyer's sense in which a claim is justified
by being traced step by step back to some acknowledged
and accepted right<note place='foot'>It is the quasi-Aristotelian ἀπαγωγή, defined as the step from one
proposition to another, the knowledge of which will set the first
proposition in a full light.</note>. It is a regressive method which
shows us that if the original datum is to be accepted it
carries along with it the legitimation of the consequence.
This method Fichte applies to psychology. Begin, he
says like Condillac, with the barest nucleus of soul-life;
the mere sentiency, or feeling: the contact, as it were,
with being, at a single point. But such a mere point
is unthinkable. You find, as Mr. Spencer says, that
<q>Thought</q> (or Consciousness) <q>cannot be framed out of
one term only.</q> <q>Every sensation to be known as one
must be perceived.</q> Such is the nature of the Ego&mdash;a
subject which insists on each part being qualified by the
whole and so transformed. As Mr. Spencer, again, puts
it, the mind not merely tends to revive, to associate, to
assimilate, to represent its own presentations, but it
carries on this process infinitely and in ever higher
multiples. Ideas as it were are growing in complexity
by re-presenting: i.e. by embracing and enveloping
elements which cannot be found existing in separation.
In the mind there is no mere presentation, no bare
sensation. Such a unit is a fiction or hypothesis we
employ, like the atom, for purposes of explanation. The
pure sensation therefore&mdash;which you admit because you
must have something to begin with, not a mere nothing,
but something so simple that it seems to stand out clear
and indisputable&mdash;this pure sensation, when you think
of it, forces you to go a good deal further. Even to be
itself, it must be more than itself. It is like the pure
or mere being of the logicians. Admit the simple
<pb n='cxii'/><anchor id='Pgcxii'/>
sensation&mdash;and you have admitted everything which
is required to make sensation a possible reality. But
you do not&mdash;in the sense of vulgar logic&mdash;deduce what
follows out of the beginning. From that, taken by itself,
you will get only itself: mere being will give you only
nothing, to the end of the chapter. But, as the phrase
is, sensation is an element in a consciousness: it is,
when you think of it, always more than you called it:
there is a curious <q>continuity</q> about the phenomena,
which makes real isolation impossible.
</p>

<p>
Of course this <q>deduction</q> is not history: it is logic.
It says, if you posit sensation, then in doing so, you
posit a good deal more. You have imagination, reason,
and many more, all involved in your original assumption.
And there is a further point to be noted. You
cannot really stop even at reason, at intelligence and
will, if you take these in the full sense. You must
realise that these only exist as part and parcel of a
reasonable world. An individual intelligence presupposes
a society of intelligences. The successive steps
in this argument are presented by Fichte in the chief
works of his earlier period (1794-98). The works of
that period form a kind of trilogy of philosophy, by
which the faint outlines of the absolute selfhood is
shown acquiring definite consistency in the moral
organisation of society. First comes the <q>Foundation
for the collective philosophy.</q> It shows how our conception
of reality and our psychical organisation are
inevitably presupposed in the barest function of intelligence,
in the abstractest forms of logical law. Begin
where you like, with the most abstract and formal point
of consciousness, you are forced, as you dwell upon it
(you identifying yourself with the thought you realise),
to go step by step on till you accept as a self-consistent
and self-explanatory unity all that your cognitive and
<pb n='cxiii'/><anchor id='Pgcxiii'/>
volitional nature claims to own as its birthright.
Only in such an intelligent will is perception and
sensation possible. Next came the <q>Foundation of
Natural Law, on the principles of the general theory.</q>
Here the process of deduction is carried a step further.
If man is to realise himself as an intelligence with an
inherent bent to action, then he must be conceived as
a person among persons, as possessed of rights, as
incapable of acting without at the same moment claiming
for his acts recognition, generality, and logical
consecution. The reference, which in the conception
of a practical intelligence was implicit,&mdash;the reference
to fellow-agents, to a world in which law rules&mdash;is thus,
by the explicit recognition of these references, made
a fact patent and positive&mdash;<foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>gesetzt</foreign>,&mdash;expressly instituted
in the way that the nature and condition of things
postulates. But this is not all: we step from the
formal and absolute into the material and relative. If
man is to be a real intelligence, he must be an intelligence
served by organs. <q>The rational being cannot
realise its efficient individuality, unless it ascribes to
itself a material body</q>: a body, moreover, in which
Fichte believes he can show that the details of structure
and organs are equally with the general corporeity
predetermined by reason<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Grundlage des Naturrechts</hi>, § 5.</note>. In the same way it is shown
that the social and political organisation is required
for the realisation&mdash;the making positive and yet
coherent&mdash;of the rights of all individuals. You deduce
society by showing it is required to make a genuine
individual man. Thirdly came the <q>System of Ethics.</q>
Here it is further argued that, at least in a certain
respect<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>System der Sittenlehre</hi>, § 8, iv.</note>, in spite of my absolute reason and my absolute
freedom, I can only be fully real as a part of Nature:
<pb n='cxiv'/><anchor id='Pgcxiv'/>
that my reason is realised in a creature of appetite
and impulse. From first to last this deduction is one
process which may be said to have for its object to
determine <q>the conditions of self-hood or egoity.</q> It
is the deduction of the concrete and empirical moral
agent&mdash;the actual ego of actual life&mdash;from the abstract,
unconditioned ego, which in order to be actual must
condescend to be at once determining and determined.
</p>

<p>
In all of this Fichte makes&mdash;especially formally&mdash;a
decided advance upon Kant. In Ethics Kant in particular,
(&mdash;especially for readers who never got beyond
the beginning of his moral treatise and were overpowered
by the categorical imperative of duty) had
found the moral initiative or dynamic apparently in the
other world. The voice of duty seemed to speak from
a region outside and beyond the individual conscience.
In a sense it must do so: but it comes from a consciousness
which is, and yet is more than, the individual.
It is indeed true that appearances here are deceptive:
and that the idea of autonomy, the self-legislation of
reason, is trying to become the central conception of
Kant's Ethics. Still it is Fichte's merit to have seen
this clearly, to have held it in view unfalteringly, and
to have carried it out in undeviating system or deduction.
Man, intelligent, social, ethical, is a being all of
one piece and to be explained entirely immanently, or
from himself. Law and ethics are no accident either
to sense or to intelligence&mdash;nothing imposed by mere
external or supernal authority<note place='foot'>Even though religion (according to Kant) conceive them as divine
commands.</note>. Society is not a brand-new
order of things supervening upon and superseding
a state of nature, where the individual was entirely
self-supporting. Morals, law, society, are all necessary
steps (necessary i.e. in logic, and hence in the long run
<pb n='cxv'/><anchor id='Pgcxv'/>
also inevitable in course of time) to complete the full
evolution or realisation of a human being. The same
conditions as make man intelligent make him social
and moral. He does not proceed so far as to become
intelligent and practical, under terms of natural and
logical development, then to fall into the hands of a
foreign influence, an accident <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>ab extra</foreign>, which causes
him to become social and moral. Rather he is intelligent,
because he is a social agent.
</p>

<p>
Hence, in Fichte, the absence of the ascetic element
so often stamping its character on ethics, and representing
the moral life as the enemy of the natural, or
as mainly a struggle to subdue the sensibility and the
flesh. With Kant,&mdash;as becomes his position of mere
inquirer&mdash;the sensibility has the place of a predominant
and permanent foreground. Reason, to his way
of talking, is always something of an intruder, a
stranger from a far-off world, to be feared even when
obeyed: sublime, rather than beautiful. From the land
of sense which we habitually occupy, the land of reason
is a country we can only behold from afar: or if we
can be said to have a standpoint in it, that is only
a figurative way of saying that though it is really over
the border, we can act&mdash;it would sometimes seem by
a sort of make-believe&mdash;as if we were already there.
But these moments of high enthusiasm are rare; and
Kant commends sobriety and warns against high-minded
<foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Schwärmerei</foreign>, or over-strained Mysticism. For
us it is reserved to struggle with a recalcitrant selfhood,
a grovelling sensibility: it were only fantastic
extravagance, fit for <q>fair souls</q> who unfortunately
often lapse into <q>fair sinners,</q> should we fancy ourselves
already anchored in the haven of untempted
rest and peace.
</p>

<p>
When we come to Fichte, we find another spirit
<pb n='cxvi'/><anchor id='Pgcxvi'/>
breathing. We have passed from the age of Frederick
the Great to the age of the French Revolution; and
the breeze that burst in the War of Liberation is
already beginning to freshen the air. Boldly he pronounces
the primacy of that faith of reason whereby not
merely the just but all shall live. Your will shall show
you what you really are. You are essentially a rational
will, or a will-reason. Your sensuous nature, of impulse
and appetite, far from being the given and found
obstacle to the realisation of reason,&mdash;which Kant
strictly interpreted might sometimes seem to imply&mdash;(and
in this point Schopenhauer carries out the implications
of Kant)&mdash;is really the condition or mode of
being which reason assumes, or rises up to, in order to
be a practical or moral being. Far from the body and
the sensible needs being a stumbling-block to hamper
the free fullness of rationality and morality, the truth
rather is that it is only by body and sense, by flesh
and blood, that the full moral and rational life can be
realised<note place='foot'>Cf. Hegel's <hi rend='italic'>Werke</hi>, vii. 2, p. 236 (Lecture-note on § 410). <q>We
must treat as utterly empty the fancy of those who suppose that
properly man should have no organic body,</q> &amp;c.; and see p. <ref target='Pg159'>159</ref> of
the present work.</note>. Or, to put it otherwise, if human reason
(intelligence and will) is to be more than a mere and
empty inner possibility, if man is to be a real and
concrete cognitive and volitional being, he must be
a member of an ethical and actual society, which lives
by bread, and which marries and has children.

<head>(iii.) Psychology in Ethics.</head>

<p>
In this way, for Fichte, and through Fichte still
more decidedly for Hegel, both psychology and ethics
<pb n='cxvii'/><anchor id='Pgcxvii'/>
breathe an opener and ampler air than they often
enjoy. Psychology ceases to be a mere description
of psychic events, and becomes the history of the self-organising
process of human reason. Ethics loses its
cloistered, negative, unnatural aspect, and becomes
a name for some further conditions of the same
development, essentially postulated to complete or
supplement its shortcomings. Psychology&mdash;taken in
this high philosophical acceptation&mdash;thus leads on to
Ethics; and Ethics is parted by no impassable line
from Psychology. That, at least, is what must happen
if they are still to retain a place in philosophy: for,
as Kant says<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Criticism of Pure Reason</hi>, Architectonic.</note>, <q>under the government of reason our
cognitions cannot form a rhapsody, but must constitute
a system, in which alone can they support and further
its essential aims.</q> As parts of such a system, they
carry out their special work in subordination to, and
in the realisation of, a single Idea&mdash;and therefore in
essential interconnexion. From that interconnecting
band we may however in detail-enquiry dispense ourselves;
and then we have the empirical or inductive
sciences of psychology and ethics. But even with
these, the necessity of the situation is such that it is
only a question of degree how far we lose sight of
the philosophical horizon, and entrench ourselves in
special enquiry. Something of the philosophic largeness
must always guide us; even when, to further the
interests of the whole, it is necessary for the special
enquirer to bury himself entirely in his part. So long
as each part is sincerely and thoroughly pursued, and
no part is neglected, there is an indwelling reason in
the parts which will in the long run tend to constitute
the total.
</p>

<p>
A philosophical psychology will show us how the
<pb n='cxviii'/><anchor id='Pgcxviii'/>
sane intelligence and the rational will are, at least
approximately, built up out of elements, and through
stages and processes, which modify and complement,
as they may also arrest and perplex, each other. The
unity, coherence, and completeness of the intelligent
self is not, as vulgar irreflectiveness supposes and
somewhat angrily maintains, a full-grown thing or
agent, of whose actions and modes of behaviour the
psychologist has to narrate the history,&mdash;a history
which is too apt to degenerate into the anecdotal and
the merely interesting. This unity of self has to be
<q>deduced,</q> as Fichte would say: it has to be shown
as the necessary result which certain elements in a
certain order will lead to<note place='foot'>Spencer, <hi rend='italic'>Psychology</hi>, i. 291: <q>Mind can be understood only by
observing how mind is evolved.</q></note>. A normal mind, self-possessed,
developed and articulated, yet thoroughly
one, a real microcosm, or true and full monad, which
under the mode of its individuality still represents the
universe: that is, what psychology has to show as the
product of factors and processes. And it is clearly
something great and good, something valuable, and
already possessing, by implication we may say, an
ethical character.
</p>

<p>
In philosophy, at least, it is difficult, or rather impossible
to draw a hard and fast line which shall demarcate
ethical from non-ethical characters,&mdash;to separate them
from other intellectual and reasonable motives. Kant,
as we know, attempted to do so: but with the result
that he was forced to add a doubt whether a purely
moral act could ever be said to exist<note place='foot'>Cf. Spencer, <hi rend='italic'>Principles of Ethics</hi>, i. 339: <q>The ethical sentiment
proper is, in the great mass of cases, scarcely discernible.</q></note>; or rather to
express the certainty that if it did it was for ever
inaccessible to observation. All such designations of
<pb n='cxix'/><anchor id='Pgcxix'/>
the several <q>factors</q> or <q>moments</q> in reality, as has
been hinted, are only <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>a potiori</foreign>. But they are misused
when it is supposed that they connote abrupt and total
discontinuity. And Kant, after all, only repeated in
his own terminology an old and inveterate habit of
thought:&mdash;the habit which in Stoicism seemed to see
sage and foolish utterly separated, and which in the
straiter sects of Christendom fenced off saint absolutely
from sinner. It is a habit to which Hegel, and even his
immediate predecessors, are radically opposed. With
Herder, he might say, <q>Ethics is only a higher physics
of the mind<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Prolegomena to the Study of Hegel</hi>, p. 143.</note>.</q> This&mdash;the truth in Spinozism&mdash;no doubt
demands some emphasis on the word <q>higher</q>: and it
requires us to read ethics (or something like it) into
physics; but it is a step on the right road,&mdash;the step
which Utilitarianism and Evolutionism had (however
awkwardly) got their foot upon, and which <q>transcendent</q>
ethics seems unduly afraid of committing itself to.
Let us say, if we like, that the mind is more than mere
nature, and that it is no proper object of a merely
natural science. But let us remember that a merely
natural science is only a fragment of science: let us
add that the <emph>merely</emph> natural is an abstraction which in
part denaturalises and mutilates the larger nature&mdash;a
nature which includes the natural mind, and cannot
altogether exclude the ethical.
</p>

<p>
What have been called <q>formal duties<note place='foot'>Windelband (W.), <hi rend='italic'>Präludien</hi> (1884), p. 288.</note></q> seem to
fall under this range&mdash;the province of a philosophical
psychology which unveils the conditions of personality.
Under that heading may be put self-control, consistency,
resolution, energy, forethought, prudence, and the like.
The due proportion of faculty, the correspondence of
head and heart, the vivacity and quickness of sympathy,
<pb n='cxx'/><anchor id='Pgcxx'/>
the ease and simplicity of mental tone, the due vigour
of memory and the grace of imagination, sweetness of
temper, and the like, are parts of the same group<note place='foot'>Cf. Plato, <hi rend='italic'>Republic</hi>, p. 486.</note>.
They are lovely, and of good report: they are praise
and virtue. If it be urged that they are only natural
gifts and graces, that objection cuts two ways. The
objector may of course be reminded that religion tones
down the self-complacency of morality. Yet, first, even
apart from that, it may be said that of virtues, which
stand independent of natural conditions&mdash;of external
supply of means (as Aristotle would say)&mdash;nothing can
be known and nothing need be said. And secondly,
none of these qualities are mere gifts;&mdash;all require
exercise, habituation, energising, to get and keep them.
How much and how little in each case is nature's and
how much ours is a problem which has some personal
interest&mdash;due perhaps to a rather selfish and envious
curiosity. But on the broad field of experience and
history we may perhaps accept the&mdash;apparently one-sided&mdash;proverb
that <q>Each man is the architect of his
own fortune.</q> Be this as it may, it will not do to
deny the ethical character of these <q>formal duties</q> on
the ground e.g. that self-control, prudence, and even
sweetness of temper may be used for evil ends,&mdash;that
one may smile and smile, and yet be a villain. That&mdash;let
us reply,&mdash;on one hand, is a fault (if fault it be)
incidental to all virtues in detail (for every single quality
has its defect): nay it may be a limitation attaching to
the whole ethical sphere: and, secondly, its inevitable
limitation does not render the virtue in any case one
whit less genuine so far as it goes. And yet of such
virtues it may be said, as Hume<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Human Nature: Morals</hi>, Part III.</note> would say (who calls
them <q>natural,</q> as opposed to the more artificial merits
<pb n='cxxi'/><anchor id='Pgcxxi'/>
of justice and its kin), that they please in themselves, or
in the mere contemplation, and without any regard to
their social effects. But they please as entering into
our idea of complete human nature, of mind and spirit
as will and intellect.
</p>

<p>
The moralists of last century sometimes divided the
field of ethics by assigning to man three grades or kinds
of duty: duties to himself, duties to society, and duties
to God. For the distinction there is a good deal to be
said: there are also faults to be found with it. It may
be said, amongst other things, that to speak of duties to
self is a metaphorical way of talking, and that God lies
out of the range of human duty altogether, except in so
far as religious service forms a part of social obligation.
It may be urged that man is essentially a social being,
and that it is only in his relations to other such beings
that his morality can find a sphere. The sphere of
morality, according to Dr. Bain, embraces whatever
<q>society has seen fit to enforce with all the rigour of
positive inflictions. Positive good deeds and self-sacrifice
... transcend the region of morality proper
and occupy a sphere of their own<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Emotion and Will</hi>, ch. xv. § 23.</note>.</q> And there is little
doubt that this restriction is in accordance with a main
current of usage. It may even be said that there are
tendencies towards a narrower usage still, which would
restrict the term to questions affecting the relations of
the sexes. But, without going so far, we may accept
the standpoint which finds in the phrase <q>popular or
social</q> sanction, as equivalent to the moral sanction, a
description of the average level of common opinion on
the topic. The morality of an age or country thus denotes,
first, the average requirement in act and behaviour
imposed by general consent on the members of a community,
and secondly, the average performance of the
<pb n='cxxii'/><anchor id='Pgcxxii'/>
members in response to these requirements. Generally
speaking the two will be pretty much the same. If the
society is in a state of equilibrium, there will be a
palpable agreement between what all severally expect
and what all severally perform. On the other hand, as
no society is ever in complete equilibrium, this harmony
will never be perfect and may often be widely departed
from. In what is called a single community, if it reach
a considerable bulk, there are (in other words) often a
number of minor societies, more or less thwarting and
modifying each other; and different observers, who
belong in the main to one or other of these subordinate
groups, may elicit from the facts before them a somewhat
different social code, and a different grade of
social observance. Still, with whatever diversity of
detail, the important feature of such social ethics is that
the stress is laid on the performance of certain acts, in
accordance with the organisation of society. So long
as the required compliance is given, public opinion is
satisfied, and morality has got its due.
</p>

<p>
But in two directions this conception of morality needs
to be supplementing. There is, on one hand, what is
called duty to God. The phrase is not altogether appropriate:
for it follows too closely the analogy of social
requirement, and treats Deity as an additional and
social authority,&mdash;a lord paramount over merely human
sovereigns. But though there may be some use in the
analogy, to press the conception is seriously to narrow
the divine character and the scope of religion. As in
similar cases, we cannot change one term without altering
its correlative. And therefore to describe our relation
to God under the name of duty is to narrow and falsify
that relation. The word is no longer applicable in this
connexion without a strain, and where it exists it
indicates the survival of a conception of theocracy:
<pb n='cxxiii'/><anchor id='Pgcxxiii'/>
of God regarded as a glorification of the magistrate, as
king of kings and lord of lords. It is the social world&mdash;and
indeed we may say the outside of the social world&mdash;that
is the sphere of duties. Duty is still with these
reductions a great august name: but in literal strictness
it only rules over the medial sphere of life, the sphere
which lies between the individual as such and his
universal humanity<note place='foot'>It is characteristic of the Kantian doctrine to absolutise the
conception of Duty and make it express the essence of the whole
ethical idea.</note>. Beyond duty, lies the sphere
of conscience and of religion. And that is not the
mere insistence by the individual to have a voice and
a vote in determining the social order. It is the sense
that the social order, however omnipotent it may seem,
is limited and finite, and that man has in him a kindred
with the Eternal.
</p>

<p>
It is not very satisfactory, either, as Aristotle and
others have pointed out, to speak of man's duties to
himself. The phrase is analogical, like the other. But
it has the merit, like that of duty to God, of reminding us
that the ordinary latitude occupied by morality is not
all that comes under the larger scope of ethics. The
<q>ethics of individual life</q> is a subject which Mr. Spencer
has touched upon: and by this title, he means that,
besides his general relationship to others, a human
being has to mind his own health, food, and amusement,
and has duties as husband and parent. But, after
all, these are not matters of peculiarly individual interest.
They rather refer to points which society at certain
epochs leaves to the common sense of the agent,&mdash;apparently
on an assumption that he is the person
chiefly interested. And these points&mdash;as the Greeks
taught long ago&mdash;are of fundamental importance: they
are the very bases of life. Yet the comparative neglect
<pb n='cxxiv'/><anchor id='Pgcxxiv'/>
in which so-called civilised societies<note place='foot'>Which are still, as the Socialist Fourier says, states of social
incoherence, specially favourable to falsehood.</note> hold the precepts
of wisdom in relation to bodily health and vigour, in
regard to marriage and progeny, serve to illustrate the
doctrine of the ancient Stoics that πάντα ὑπόληψις, or the
modern idealist utterance that the World is my idea.
More and more as civilisation succeeds in its disruption
of man from nature, it shows him governed not by bare
facts and isolated experiences, but by the systematic idea
under which all things are subsumed. He loses the
naïveté of the natural man, which takes each fact as
it came, all alike good: he becomes sentimental, and
artificial, sees things under a conventional point of
view, and would rather die than not be in the fashion.
And this tendency is apparently irresistible. Yet the
mistake lies in the one-sidedness of sentiment and convention.
Not the domination of the idea is evil; but
the domination of a partial and fragmentary idea: and
this is what constitutes the evil of artificiality. And
the correction must lie not in a return to nature, but in
the reconstruction of a wider and more comprehensive
idea: an idea which shall be the unity and system of all
nature; not a fantastic idealism, but an attempt to do
justice to the more realist as well as the idealist sides
of life.
</p>

<p>
There is however another side of individualist ethics
which needs even more especial enforcement. It is the
formation of
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<lg>
<l><q rend='pre'>The reason firm, the temperate will,</q></l>
<l><q rend='post'>Endurance, foresight, strength and skill:</q></l>
</lg>
</quote>

<p>
the healthy mind in a healthy body. Ethics is only too
apt to suppose that will and intelligence are assumptions
which need no special justification. But the truth is that
they vary from individual to individual in degree and
<pb n='cxxv'/><anchor id='Pgcxxv'/>
structure. It is the business of ethical psychology to give
to these vague attributions the definiteness of a normal
standard: to show what proportions are required to justify
the proper title of reason and will&mdash;to show what reason
and will really are if they do what they are encouraged
or expected to do. It talks of the diseases of will and
personality: it must also set forth their educational
ideal. The first problem of Ethics, it may be said, is
the question of the will and its freedom. But to say
this is of course not to say that, unless freedom of will
be understood in some special sense, ethics becomes
impossible. If the moral law is the <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>ratio cognoscendi</foreign>
of freedom, then must our conception of morality and
of freedom hang together. And it will clearly be
indispensable to begin by some attempt to discover
in what sense man may be in the most general way
described as a moral agent&mdash;as an intelligent will, or
(more briefly, yet synonymously) as a will. <q>The soil
of law and morality,</q> says Hegel<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Rechtsphilosophie</hi>, § 4.</note>, <q>is the intelligent life:
and its more precise place and starting-point the will,
which is free, in the sense that freedom is its substance
and characteristic, and the system of law the realm of
freedom realised, the world of intelligence produced out
of itself as a second nature.</q> Such a freedom is a freedom
made and acquired, the work of the mind's self-realisation,
not to be taken as a given fact of consciousness
which must be believed<note place='foot'>Cf. Schelling, ii. 12: <q>There are no <emph>born</emph> sons of freedom.</q></note>. To have a will&mdash;in other
words, to have freedom, is the consummation&mdash;and
let us add, only the formal or ideal consummation&mdash;of
a process by which man raises himself out of his
absorption in sensation and impulse, establishes within
himself a mental realm, an organism of ideas, a self-consciousness,
and a self.
</p>

<pb n='cxxvi'/><anchor id='Pgcxxvi'/>

<p>
The vulgar apprehension of these things seems to
assume that we have by nature, or are born with, a
general faculty or set of general faculties, which we
subsequently fill up and embody by the aid of experience.
We possess&mdash;they seem to imply&mdash;so many
<q>forms</q> and <q>categories</q> latent in our minds ready to
hold and contain the raw materials supplied from without.
According to this view we have all a will and an
intelligence: the difference only is that some put more
into them, and some put less. But such a separation of
the general form from its contents is a piece of pure
mythology. It is perhaps true and safe to say that
the human being is of such a character that will and
intelligence are in the ordinary course inevitably
produced. But the forms which grow up are the more
and more definite and systematic organisation of a graded
experience, of series of ideas, working themselves up
again and again in representative and re-representative
degree, till they constitute a mental or inner world of
their own. The will is thus the title appropriate to the
final stage of a process, by which sensation and impulse
have polished and perfected themselves by union and
opposition, by differentiation and accompanying redintegration,
till they assume characters quite unsurmised in
their earliest aspects, and yet only the consolidation or
self-realisation of implications. Thus the mental faculties
are essentially acquired powers,&mdash;acquired not from
without, but by action which generates the faculties it
seems to imply. The process of mind is a process which
creates individual centres, raises them to completer independence;&mdash;which
produces an inner life more and
more self-centered and also more and more equal to
the universe which it has embodied. And will and
intelligence are an important stage in that process.
</p>

<p>
Herbart (as was briefly hinted at in the first essay)
<pb n='cxxvii'/><anchor id='Pgcxxvii'/>
has analysed ethical appreciation (which may or may
not be accompanied by approbation) into five distinct
standard ideas. These are the ideas of inward liberty,
of perfection, of right, benevolence, and equity. Like
Hume, he regards the moral judgment as in its purity
a kind of aesthetic pronouncement on the agreement
or proportion of certain activities in relations to each
other. Two of these standard ideas,&mdash;that of inward
liberty and of perfection&mdash;seem to belong to the
sphere at present under review. They emerge as
conditions determining the normal development of
human nature to an intelligent and matured personality.
By inward freedom Herbart means the harmony between
the will and the intellect: what Aristotle has named
<q>practical truth or reality,</q> and what he describes in his
conception of wisdom or moral intelligence,&mdash;the power
of discerning the right path and of pursuing it with will
and temper: the unity, clear but indissoluble, of will
and discernment. By the idea of perfection Herbart
means the sense of proportion and of propriety which is
awakened by comparing a progress in development or
an increase in strength with its earlier stages of promise
and imperfection. The pleasure such perception affords
works in two ways: it is a satisfaction in achievement
past, and a stimulus to achievement yet to come.
</p>

<p>
Such ideas of inward liberty and of growth in ability
or in performance govern (at least in part) our judgment
of the individual, and have an ethical significance.
Indeed, if the cardinal feature of the ethical sentiment
be the inwardness and independence of its approbation
and obligation, these ideas lie at the root of all true
morality. Inward harmony and inward progress, lucidity
of conscience and the resolution which knows no finality
of effort, are the very essence of moral life. Yet, if
ethics is to include in the first instance social relationships
<pb n='cxxviii'/><anchor id='Pgcxxviii'/>
and external utilities and sanctions, these conditions
of true life must rather be described as pre-ethical.
The truth seems to be that here we get to a range of
ethics which is far wider than what is ordinarily called
practice and conduct. At this stage logic, aesthetic, and
ethic, are yet one: the true, the good, and the beautiful
are still held in their fundamental unity. An ethics of
wide principle precedes its narrower social application;
and whereas in ordinary usage the social provinciality
is allowed to prevail, here the higher ethics emerge
clear and imperial above the limitations of local and
temporal duty.
</p>

<p>
And though it is easy to step into exaggeration, it is
still well to emphasise this larger conception of ethics.
The moral principle of the <q>maximising of life,</q> as it
has been called<note place='foot'>Simmel (G.), <hi rend='italic'>Einleitung in die Moralwissenschaft</hi>, i. 184.</note>, may be open to misconception (&mdash;so,
unfortunately are all moral principles when stated in
the effrontery of isolation): but it has its truth in the
conviction that all moral evil is marked by a tendency
to lower or lessen the total vitality. So too Friedrich
Nietzsche's maxim, <foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Sei vornehm</foreign><note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Jenseits von Gut und Böse</hi>, p. 225.</note>, ensue distinction,
and above all things be not common or vulgar (<foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>gemein</foreign>),
will easily lend itself to distortion. But it is good advice
for all that, even though it may be difficult to define
in a general formula wherein distinction consists, to
mark the boundary between self-respect and vanity or
obstinacy, or to say wherein lies the beauty and dignity
of human nature. Kant has laid it down as the principle
of duty to ask ourselves if in our act we are prepared to
universalise the maxim implied by our conduct. And
that this&mdash;which essentially bids us look at an act in the
whole of its relations and context&mdash;is a safeguard against
some forms of moral evil, is certain. But there is an
<pb n='cxxix'/><anchor id='Pgcxxix'/>
opposite&mdash;or rather an apparently opposite&mdash;principle
which bids us be individual, be true to our own
selves, and never allow ourselves to be dismayed from
our own unique responsibility. Perhaps the two
principles are not so far apart as they seem. In any
case true individuality is the last word and the first
word in ethics; though, it may be added, there is a good
deal to be said between the two termini.
</p>

<div>
<head>(iv.) An Excursus on Greek Ethics.</head>

<p>
It is in these regions that Greek ethics loves to linger;
on the duty of the individual to himself, to be perfectly
lucid and true, and to rise to ever higher heights of
achievement. <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>Ceteris paribus</foreign>, there is felt to be something
meritorious in superiority, something good:&mdash;even
were it that you are master, and another is slave. Thus
naïvely speaks Aristotle<note place='foot'>Aristot. <hi rend='italic'>Polit.</hi> i. 6.</note>. To a modern, set amid so
many conflicting ideals, perhaps, the immense possibilities
of yet further growth might suggest themselves with
overpowering force. To him the idea of perfection takes
the form of an idea of perfectibility: and sometimes it
smites down his conceit in what he has actually done,
and impresses a sense of humility in comparison with
what yet remains unaccomplished. An ancient Greek
apparently was little haunted by these vistas of possibilities
of progress through worlds beyond worlds. A
comparatively simple environment, a fixed and definite
mental horizon, had its plain and definite standards, or
at least seemed to have such. There were fewer cases
of the man, unattached or faintly attached to any
<pb n='cxxx'/><anchor id='Pgcxxx'/>
definite profession&mdash;moving about in worlds half realised&mdash;who
has grown so common in a more developed
civilisation. The ideals of the Greek were clearly
descried: each man had his definite function or work
to perform: and to do it better than the average, or than
he himself habitually had done, that was perfection,
excellence, virtue. For virtue to the Greek is essentially
ability and respectability: promise of excellent performance:
capacity to do better than others. Virtue is
praiseworthy or meritorious character and quality: it
is achievement at a higher rate, as set against one's past
and against others' average.
</p>

<p>
The Greek moralists sometimes distinguish and
sometimes combine moral virtue and wisdom, ἀρετή and
φρόνησις: capacity to perform, and wisdom to guide
that capacity. To the ordinary Greek perhaps the
emphasis fell on the former, on the attainment of all
recognised good quality which became a man, all that
was beautiful and honourable, all that was appropriate,
glorious, and fame-giving; and that not for any special
reference to its utilitarian qualities. Useful, of course,
such qualities were: but that was not in question at the
time. In the more liberal commonwealths of ancient
Greece there was little or no anxious care to control
the education of its citizens, so as to get direct service,
overt contribution to the public good. A suspicious
Spartan legislation might claim to do that. But in the
free air of Athens all that was required was loyalty,
good-will&mdash;εὔνοια&mdash;to the common weal; it might be
even a sentiment of human kindliness, of fraternity of
spirit and purpose. Everything beyond and upon that
basis was left to free development. Let each carry out
to the full the development of his powers in the line
which national estimation points out. He is&mdash;nature
and history alike emphasise that fact beyond the reach
<pb n='cxxxi'/><anchor id='Pgcxxxi'/>
of doubt, for all except the outlaw and the casual
stranger&mdash;a member of a community, and as such has
a governing instinct and ideal which animates him.
But he is also a self-centered individual, with special
endowments of nature, in his own person and in the
material objects which are his. A purely individualist
or selfish use of them is not&mdash;to the normal Greek&mdash;even
dreamed of. He is too deeply rooted in the substance
of his community for that: or it is on the ground and
in the atmosphere of an assured community that his
individuality is to be made to flourish. Nature has
secured that his individuality shall rest securely in the
presupposition of his citizenship. It seems, therefore,
as if he were left free and independent in his personal
search for perfection, for distinction. His place is fixed
for him: <foreign rend='italic'>Spartam nactus es; hanc orna</foreign>: his duty is his
virtue. That duty, as Plato expresses it, is to do his
own deeds&mdash;and not meddle with others. Nature and
history have arranged that others, in other posts, shall
do theirs: that all severally shall energise their function.
The very word <q>duty</q> seems out of place; if, at
least, duty suggests external obligation, an order imposed
and a debt to be discharged. If there be a task-master
and a creditor, it is the inflexible order of nature
and history:&mdash;or, to be more accurate, of nature, the
indwelling and permanent reality of things. But the
obligation to follow nature is scarcely felt as a yoke of
constraint. A man's virtue is to perform his work and
to perform it well: to do what he is specially capable of
doing, and therefore specially charged to do.
</p>

<p>
Nowhere has this character of Greek ethics received
more classical expression than in the Republic of Plato.
In the prelude to his subject&mdash;which is the nature of
Right and Morality&mdash;Plato has touched briefly on certain
popular and inadequate views. There is the view
<pb n='cxxxii'/><anchor id='Pgcxxxii'/>
that Right has its province in performance of certain
single and external acts&mdash;in business honesty and commercial
straightforwardness. There is the view that
it is rendering to each what is due to him; that it
consists in the proper reciprocity of services, in the
balance of social give and take. There is the critical
or hyper-critical view which, from seeing so much that
is called justice to be in harmony with the interest of
the predominant social order, bluntly identifies mere
force or strength as the ground of right. And there
are views which regard it as due to social conventions
and artifices, to the influence of education, to political
arrangements and the operation of irrational prejudices.
To all these views Plato objects: not because they are
false&mdash;for they are all in part, often in large part, true&mdash;but
because they are inadequate and do not go to the
root of the matter. The foundations of right lie, he
says, not in external act, but in the inner man: not in
convention, but in nature: not in relation to others,
but in the constitution of the soul itself. That ethical
idea&mdash;the idea of right&mdash;which seems most obviously
to have its centre outside the individual, to live and
grow only in the relations between individuals, Plato
selects in order to show the independent royalty of the
single human soul. The world, as Hume afterwards,
called justice artificial: Plato will prove it natural.
In a way he joins company with those who bid us drive
out the spectre of duty, of obligation coming upon the
soul from social authority, from traditional idea, from
religious sanctions. He preaches&mdash;or he is about to
preach&mdash;the autonomy of the will.
</p>

<p>
The four cardinal virtues of Plato's list are the qualities
which go to make a healthy, normal, natural human
soul, fit for all activity, equipped with all arms for the
battle of life. They tell us what such a soul is, not
<pb n='cxxxiii'/><anchor id='Pgcxxxiii'/>
what it does. They are the qualities which unless
a soul has, and has them each perfect, yet all co-operant,
its mere outward and single acts have no
virtue or merit, but are only lucky accidents at the best.
On the other hand, if a man has these constitutive
qualities, he will act in the social world, and act well.
Plato has said scornful things of mere outward and
verbal truthfulness, and has set at the very lowest pitch
of degradation the <q>lie in the soul.</q> His <q>temperance</q>
or <q>self-restraint,</q> if it be far from breathing any suggestion
of self-suppression or self-assertion, is still farther
from any suspicion of asceticism, or war against the
flesh. It is the noble harmony of the ruling and the
ruled, which makes the latter a partner of the sovereign,
and takes from the dictates of the ruler any touch of
coercion. It is literally sanity of soul, integrity and
purity of spirit; it is what has been sometimes called
the beautiful soul&mdash;the indiscerptible unity of reason
and impulse. Plato's bravery, again, is fortitude and
consistency of soul, the full-blooded heart which is fixed
in reason, the zeal which is according to knowledge,
unflinching loyalty to the idea, the spirit which burns in
the martyrs to truth and humanity: yet withal with
gentleness and courtesy and noble urbanity in its
immediate train. And his truthfulness is that inner
lucidity which cannot be self-deceived, the spirit which
is a safeguard against fanaticism and hypocrisy, the
sunlike warmth of intelligence without which the heart
is a darkness full of unclean things.
</p>

<p>
The full development and crowning grace of such
a manly nature Aristotle has tried to present in the
character of the Great-souled man&mdash;him whom Plato
has called the true king by divine right, or the autocrat
by the patent of nature. Like all such attempts to
delineate a type in the terms necessarily single and
<pb n='cxxxiv'/><anchor id='Pgcxxxiv'/>
successive of abstract analysis, it tends occasionally to
run into caricature, and to give partial aspects an absurd
prominency. Only the greatest of artists could cope
with such a task, though that artist may be found perhaps
classed among the historians. Yet it is possible
to form some conception of the ideal which Aristotle
would set before us. The Great-souled man <emph>is</emph> great,
and he dare not deny the witness of his spirit. He
is one who does not quail before the anger and seek the
applause of popular opinion: he holds his head as his
own, and as high as his undimmed self-consciousness
shows it is worth. There has been said to him by
the reason within him the word that Virgil erewhile
addressed to Dante:
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<lg>
<l><q rend='pre'>Libero, dritto, e sano è il tuo arbitrio</q></l>
<l>E fallo fora non fare a suo cenno;</l>
<l><q rend='post'>Per ch' io te sopra te corono e mitrio.</q></l>
</lg>
</quote>

<p>
He is his own Emperor and his own Pope. He is the
perfected man, in whom is no darkness, whose soul
is utter clearness, and complete harmony. Calm in self-possessed
majesty, he stands, if need be, <foreign rend='italic'>contra mundum</foreign>:
but rather, with the world beneath his feet. The chatter
of personality has no interest for him. Bent upon the
best, lesser competitions for distinction have no attraction
for him. To the vulgar he will seem cold, self-confined:
in his apartness and distinction they will see
the signs of a <q>prig.</q> His look will be that of one who
pities men&mdash;rather than loves them: and should he
speak ill of a foe, it is rather out of pride of heart and
unbroken spirit than because these things touch him.
Such an one, in many ways, was the Florentine poet
himself.
</p>

<p>
If the Greek world in general thus conceived ἀρετή as the
full bloom of manly excellence (we all know how slightly&mdash;witness
the remarks in the Periclean oration&mdash;Greeks,
<pb n='cxxxv'/><anchor id='Pgcxxxv'/>
in their public and official utterances, rated womanliness),
the philosophers had a further point to emphasise.
That was what they variously called knowledge, prudence,
reason, insight, intelligence, wisdom, truth.
From Socrates to Aristotle, from Aristotle to the Stoics
and Epicureans, and from the Stoics to the Neo-Platonists,
this is the common theme: the supremacy
of knowledge, its central and essential relation to
virtue. They may differ&mdash;perhaps not so widely as
current prejudice would suppose&mdash;as to how this knowledge
is to be defined, what kind of knowledge it is,
how acquired and maintained, and so on. But in essentials
they are at one. None of them, of course, mean
that in order to right conduct nothing more is needed
than to learn and remember what is right, the precepts
and commandments of ordinary morality. Memory is
not knowledge, especially when it is out of mind. Even
an ancient philosopher was not wholly devoid of common
sense. They held&mdash;what they supposed was a
fact of observation and reflection&mdash;that all action was
prompted by feelings of the values of things, by a desire
of something good or pleasing to self, and aimed at
self-satisfaction and self-realisation, but that there was
great mistake in what thus afforded satisfaction.
People chose to act wrongly or erroneously, because
they were, first, mistaken about themselves and what
they wanted, and, secondly, mistaken in the means
which would give them satisfaction. But this second
point was secondary. The main thing was to know
yourself, what you really were; in Plato's words, to
<q>see the soul as it is, and know whether it have one
form only or many, or what its nature is; to look upon
it with the eye of reason in its original purity.</q> Self-deception,
confusion, that worst ignorance which is
unaware of itself, false estimation&mdash;these are the radical
<pb n='cxxxvi'/><anchor id='Pgcxxxvi'/>
evils of the natural man. To these critics the testimony
of consciousness was worthless, unless corroborated.
To cure this mental confusion, this blindness of will
and judgment, is the task set for philosophy: to give
inward light, to teach true self-measurement. In one
passage, much misunderstood, Plato has called this
philosophic art the due measurement of pleasures and
pains. It should scarcely have been possible to mistake
the meaning. But, with the catchwords of Utilitarianism
ringing in their ears, the commentators ran straight
contrary to the true teaching of the <hi rend='italic'>Protagoras</hi>, consentient
as it is with that of the <hi rend='italic'>Phaedo</hi> and the
<hi rend='italic'>Philebus</hi>. To measure, one must have a standard: and
if Plato has one lesson always for us, it is that a sure
standard the multitude have not, but only confusion.
The so-called pleasures and pains of the world's experiences
are so entitled for different reasons, for contrary
aims, and with no unity or harmony of judgment. They
are&mdash;not a fact to be accepted, but&mdash;a problem for
investigation: their reality is in question, their genuineness,
solidity and purity: and till you have settled that,
you cannot measure, for you may be measuring vacuity
under the idea that there is substance. You have still
to get at the unit&mdash;i.e. the reality of pleasure. It was
not Plato's view that pleasure was a separate and independent
entity: that it was exactly as it was felt. Each
pleasure is dependent for its pleasurable quality on the
consciousness it belongs to, and has only a relative
truth and reality. Bentham has written about computing
the value of a <q>lot</q> of pleasures and pains. But
Plato had his mind on an earlier and more fundamental
problem, what is the truth and reality of pleasure; and
his fullest but not his only essay towards determining
the value or estimating the meaning of pleasure in the
scale of being is that given in the <hi rend='italic'>Philebus</hi>.
</p>

<pb n='cxxxvii'/><anchor id='Pgcxxxvii'/>

<p>
This then is the knowledge which Greek philosophy
meant: not mere intellect&mdash;though, of course, there is
always a danger of theoretical inquiry degenerating into
abstract and formal dogma. But of the meaning there
can be no serious doubt. It is a knowledge, says Plato,
to which the method of mathematical science&mdash;the most
perfect he can find acknowledged&mdash;is only an <foreign rend='italic'>ouverture</foreign>,
or perhaps, only the preliminary tuning of the strings.
It is a knowledge not eternally hypothetical&mdash;a system
of sequences which have no sure foundation. It is
a knowledge which rests upon the conviction and belief
of the <q>idea of good</q>: a kind of knowledge which does
not come by direct teaching, which is not mere theory,
but implies a lively conviction, a personal apprehension,
a crisis which is a kind of <q>conversion,</q> or <q>inspiration.</q>
It is as it were the prize of a great contest, in which the
sword that conquers is the sword of dialectic: a sword
whereof the property is, like that of Ithuriel's spear, to
lay bare all deceptions and illusions of life. Or, to vary
the metaphor: the son of man is like the prince in the
fairy tale who goes forth to win the true queen; but
there are many false pretenders decked out to deceive
his unwary eyes and foolish heart. Yet in himself
there is a power of discernment: there is something
kindred with the truth:&mdash;the witness of the Spirit&mdash;and
all that education and discipline can do is to remove
obstacles, especially the obstacles within the self which
perturb the sight and mislead the judgment. Were not
the soul originally possessed of and dominated by the
idea of good, it could never discern it elsewhere. On
this original kindred depends all the process of education;
the influence of which therefore is primarily
negative or auxiliary. Thus the process of history and
experience,&mdash;which the work of education only reproduces
in an accelerated <foreign rend='italic'>tempo</foreign>&mdash;serves but to bring out
<pb n='cxxxviii'/><anchor id='Pgcxxxviii'/>
the implicit reason within into explicit conformity with
the rationality of the world.
</p>

<p>
Knowledge, then, in this ethical sphere means the
harmony of will, emotion, intellect: it means the clear
light which has no illusions and no deceptions. And
to those who feel that much of their life and of the
common life is founded on prejudice and illusion, such
white light will occasionally seem hard and steely. At
its approach they fear the loss of the charm of that
twilight hour ere the day has yet begun, or before the
darkness has fully settled down. Thus the heart and
feelings look upon the intellect as an enemy of sentiment.
And Plato himself is not without anticipations of such
an issue. Yet perhaps we may add that the danger is
in part an imaginary one, and only arises because
intelligence takes its task too lightly, and encroaches
beyond its proper ground. Philosophy, in other words,
mistakes its place when it sets itself up as a dogmatic
system of life. Its function is to comprehend, and from
comprehension to criticise, and through criticising to
unify. It has no positive and additional teaching of its
own: no addition to the burden of life and experience.
And experience it must respect. Its work is to maintain
the organic or super-organic interconnexion between
all the spheres of life and all the forms of reality. It
has to prevent stagnation and absorption of departments&mdash;to
keep each in its proper place, but not more than
its place, and yet to show how each is not independent
of the others. And this is what the philosopher or
ancient sage would be. If he is passionless, it is not
that he has no passions, but that they no longer perturb
and mislead. If his controlling spirit be reason, it is
not the reason of the so-called <q>rationalist,</q> but the
reason which seeks in patience to comprehend, and to
be at home in, a world it at first finds strange. And if
<pb n='cxxxix'/><anchor id='Pgcxxxix'/>
he is critical of others, he is still more critical of
himself: critical however not for criticism's sake
(which is but a poor thing), but because through
criticism the faith of reason may be more fully justified.
To the last, if he is true to his mission and
faithful to his loyalty to reality, he will have the
simplicity of the child.
</p>

<p>
Whether therefore we agree or not with Plato's
reduction of Right and Duty to self-actualisation, we
may at least admit that in the idea of perfection or
excellence, combined with the idea of knowledge or
inward lucidity, he has got the fundamental ideas on
which further ethical development must build. Self-control,
self-knowledge, internal harmony, are good:
and so are the development of our several faculties and
of the totality of them to the fullest pitch of excellence.
But their value does not lie entirely in themselves, or
rather there is implicit in them a reference to something
beyond themselves. They take for granted something
which, because it is so taken, may also be ignored and
neglected, just because it seems so obvious. And that
implication is the social humanity in which they are the
spirits of light and leading.
</p>

<p>
To lay the stress on ἀρετή or excellence tends to
leave out of sight the force of duty; and to emphasise
knowledge is allowed to disparage the heart and feelings.
The mind&mdash;even of a philosopher&mdash;finds a difficulty in
holding very different points of view in one, and where
it is forced from one to another, tends to forget the
earlier altogether. Thus when the ethical philosopher,
presupposing as an absolute or unquestionable fact that
man the individual was rooted in the community,
proceeded to discuss the problem of the best and completest
individual estate, he was easily led to lose sight
of the fundamental and governing condition altogether.
<pb n='cxl'/><anchor id='Pgcxl'/>
From the moment that Aristotle lays down the thesis
that man is naturally social, to the moment when he
asks how the bare ideal of excellence in character and
life can become an actuality, the community in which
man lives has retired out of sight away into the background.
And it only comes in, as it first appears, as
the paedagogue to bring us to morality. And Plato,
though professedly he is speaking of the community,
and is well aware that the individual can only be saved
by the salvation of the community, is constantly falling
back into another problem&mdash;the development of an
individual soul. He feels the strength of the egoistic
effort after perfection, and his essay in the end tends to
lose sight altogether of its second theme. Instead of
a man he gives us a mere philosopher, a man, that is, not
living with his country's life, instinct with the heart and
feeling of humanity, inspired by art and religion, but
a being set apart and exalted above his fellows,&mdash;charged
no doubt in theory with the duty of saving
them, of acting vicariously as the mediator between
them and the absolute truth&mdash;but really tending more
and more to seclude himself on the <foreign rend='italic'>edita templa</foreign> of the
world, on the high-towers of speculation.
</p>

<p>
And what Plato and Aristotle did, so to speak,
against their express purpose and effort, yet did,
because the force of contemporary tendency was
irresistible&mdash;that the Stoa and Epicurus did more
openly and professedly. With a difference in theory,
it is true, owing to the difference in the surroundings.
Virtue in the older day of the free and glorious commonwealth
had meant physical and intellectual achievement,
acts done in the public eye, and of course for the public
good&mdash;a good with which the agent was identified at
least in heart and soul, if not in his explicit consciousness.
In later and worse days, when the political
<pb n='cxli'/><anchor id='Pgcxli'/>
world, with the world divine, had withdrawn from
actual identity with the central heart of the individual,
and stood over-against him as a strange power and little
better than a nuisance, virtue came to be counted as
endurance, indifference, negative independence against
a cold and a perplexing world. But even still, virtue is
excellence: it is to rise above the ignoble level: to assert
self-liberty against accident and circumstance&mdash;to attain
self-controlled, self-satisfying independence&mdash;and to
become God-like in its seclusion. Yet in two directions
even it had to acknowledge something beyond the
individual. The Epicurean&mdash;following out a suggestion
of Aristotle&mdash;recognised the help which the free society
of friends gave to the full development of the single
seeker after a self-satisfying and complete life. The
Stoic, not altogether refusing such help, tended rather
to rest his single self on a fellowship of ideal sort, on
the great city of gods and men, the <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>civitas Dei</foreign>. Thus,
in separate halves, the two schools, into which Greek
ethics was divided, gave expression to the sense that
a new and higher community was needed&mdash;to the sense
that the visible actual community no longer realised its
latent idea. The Stoic emphasised the all-embracing
necessity, the absolute comprehensiveness of the moral
kingdom. The Epicurean saw more clearly that, if the
everlasting city came from heaven, it could only visibly
arise by initiation upon the earth. Christianity&mdash;in its
best work&mdash;was a conjunction of the liberty with
the necessity, of the human with the divine.
</p>

<p>
More interesting, perhaps, it is to note the misconception
of reason and knowledge which grew up.
Knowledge came more and more to be identified with
the reflective and critical consciousness, which is outside
reality and life, and judges it from a standpoint of its
own. It came to be esteemed only in its formal and
<pb n='cxlii'/><anchor id='Pgcxlii'/>
abstract shape, and at the expense of the heart and
feelings. The antithesis of philosophy (or knowledge
strictly so called) according to Plato was mere opinion,
accidental and imperfect knowledge. The knowledge
which is truly valuable is a knowledge which presupposes
the full reality of life, and is the more and
more completely articulated theory of it as a whole. It
is&mdash;abstractly taken&mdash;a mere form of unity which has
no value except in uniting: it is&mdash;taken concretely&mdash;the
matter, we may say, in complete unity. It is ideal and
perfect harmony of thought, appetite, and emotion: or
putting it otherwise, the philosopher is one who is not
merely a creature of appetite and production, not merely
a creature of feeling and practical energy, but a creature,
who to both of these superadds an intelligence which
sets eyes in the blind forehead of these other powers,
and thus, far from superseding them altogether, only
raises them into completeness, and realises all that is
worthy in their implicit natures. Always these two
impulsive tendencies of our nature are guided by some
sort of ideas and intelligence, by beliefs and opinions.
But they, like their guides, are sporadically emergent,
unconnected, and therefore apt to be contradictory. It
is to such erratic and occasional ideas, half-truths and
deceptions, that philosophy is opposed. Unfortunately
for all parties, the antithesis is carried farther. Philosophy
and the philosopher are further set in opposition
to the faith of the heart, the intimacy and intensity of
feeling, the depth of love and trust, which in practice
often go along with imperfect ideas. The philosopher
is made one who has emancipated himself from the heart
and feelings,&mdash;a pure intelligence, who is set above all
creeds, contemplating all, and holding none. Consistency
and clearness become his idol, to be worshipped
at any cost, save one sacrifice: and that one sacrifice is
<pb n='cxliii'/><anchor id='Pgcxliii'/>
the sacrifice of his own self-conceit. For consistency
generally means that all is made to harmonise with
one assumed standpoint, and that whatever presents
discrepancies with this alleged standard is ruthlessly
thrown away. Such a philosophy mistakes its function,
which is not, as Heine scoffs, to make an intelligible
system by rejecting the discordant fragments of life, but
to follow reverently, if slowly, in the wake of experience.
Such a <q>perfect sage,</q> with his parade of reasonableness,
may often assume the post of a dictator.
</p>

<p>
And, above all, intelligence is only half itself when it
is not also will. And both are more than mere consciousness.
Plato&mdash;whom we refer to, because he is
the coryphaeus of all the diverse host of Greek philosophy&mdash;seems
to overestimate or rather to misconceive
the place of knowledge. That it is the supreme and
crowning grace of the soul, he sees. But he tends to
identify it with the supreme or higher soul:&mdash;as Aristotle
did after him, to be followed by the Stoics and
Neo-Platonists. For them the supreme, or almost
supreme reality is the intelligence or reason: the soul
is only on a second grade of reality, on the borders of
the natural or physical world. When Plato takes that
line, he turns towards the path of asceticism, and treats
the philosophic life as a preparation for that truer life
when intelligence shall be all in all, for that better land
where <q>divine dialogues</q> shall form the staple and substance
of spiritual existence. Aristotle,&mdash;who less often
treads these solitudes,&mdash;still extols the theoretic life,
when the body and its needs trouble no more, when the
activity of reason&mdash;the theory of theory&mdash;is attained at
least as entirely as mortal conditions allow man to be
deified. Of the <q>apathy</q> and the reasonable conformity
of the Stoics, or of the purely negative character of
Epicurean happiness (the excision of all that pained)
<pb n='cxliv'/><anchor id='Pgcxliv'/>
we need not here speak. And in Plotinus and Proclus
the deification of mere reason is at any rate the dominant
note; whatever protests the larger Greek nature
in the former may from time to time offer. The truth
which philosophy should have taught was that Mind
or intelligence was the element where the inner life
culminated and expanded and flourished: the error
which it often tended to spread was that intelligence
was the higher life of which all other was a degenerate
shortcoming, and something valuable on its own
account.
</p>

<p>
It may be that thus to interpret Plato is to do him an
injustice. It has been sometimes said that his division
of parts or kinds of soul&mdash;or his distinction between its
fighting horses&mdash;tends to destroy the unity of mental life.
But perhaps this was exactly what he wanted to convey.
There are&mdash;we may paraphrase his meaning&mdash;three
kinds of human being, three types of human life.
There is the man or the life of appetite and the flesh:
there is the man of noble emotion and energetic depth
of soul: there is the life of reasonable pursuits and
organised principle. Or, we may take his meaning to
be that there are three elements or provinces of mental
life, which in all except a few are but imperfectly
coherent and do not reach a true or complete unity.
Some unity there always is: but in the life of mere
appetite and impulse, even when these impulses are
our nobler sentiments of love and hatred, the unity falls
very far short. Or, as he puts the theme elsewhere,
the soul has a passion for self-completion, a love of
beauty, which in most is but a misleading lust. It is
the business of the philosophic life to re-create or to
foster this unity: or philosophy is the persistent search
of the soul for its lost unity, the search to see that unity
which is always its animating principle, its inner faith.
<pb n='cxlv'/><anchor id='Pgcxlv'/>
When the soul has reached this ideal&mdash;if it can be supposed
to attain it (and of this the strong-souled ancient
philosophers feel no doubt),&mdash;then a change must take
place. The love of beauty is not suppressed; it is only
made self-assured and its object freed from all imperfection.
It is not that passion has ceased; but its
nature is so transfigured, that it seems worthy of a
nobler name, which yet we cannot give. To such a life,
where battle and conflict are as such unknown, we
cannot longer give the title of life: and we say that
philosophy is in life a rehearsal of death<note place='foot'>Plato, <hi rend='italic'>Phaedo</hi>.</note>. And yet if
there be no battle, there is not for that reason mere
inaction. Hence, as the Republic concludes, the true
philosopher is the complete man. He is the truth and
reality which the appetitive and emotional man were
seeking after and failed to realise. It is true they at
first will not see this. But the whole long process of
philosophy is the means to induce this conviction. And
for Plato it remains clear that through experience,
through wisdom, and through abstract deduction, the
philosopher will justify his claim to him who hath ears
to hear and heart to understand. If that be so, the
asceticism of Plato is not a mere war upon flesh and
sense as such, but upon flesh and sense as imperfect
truth, fragmentary reality, which suppose themselves
complete, though they are again and again confuted by
experience, by wisdom, and by mere calculation,&mdash;a war
against their blindness and shortsightedness.

<head>Essay IV. Psycho-Genesis.</head>

<p>
<q>The key,</q> says Carus, <q>for the ascertainment of the
nature of the conscious psychical life lies in the region
of the unconscious<note place='foot'>Carus, <hi rend='italic'>Psyche</hi>, p. 1.</note>.</q> The view which these words take
is at least as old as the days of Leibniz. It means that
the mental world does not abruptly emerge a full-grown
intelligence, but has a genesis, and follows a law of
development: that its life may be described as the
differentiation (with integration) of a simple or indifferentiated
mass. The terms conscious and unconscious,
indeed, with their lax popular uses, leave the door wide
open for misconception. But they may serve to mark
that the mind is to be understood only in a certain
relation (partly of antithesis) to nature, and the soul
only in reference to the body. The so-called <q>superior
faculties</q>&mdash;specially characteristic of humanity&mdash;are
founded upon, and do not abruptly supersede, the
lower powers which are supposed to be specially
obvious in the animals<note place='foot'>See Arist., <hi rend='italic'>Anal. Post.</hi> ii. 19 (ed. Berl. 100, a. 10).</note>. The individual and specific
phenomena of consciousness, which the psychologist is
generally supposed to study, rest upon a deeper, less
explicated, more indefinite, life of sensibility, which in
its turn fades away by immeasurable gradations into
something irresponsive to the ordinary tests for sensation
and life.
</p>

<pb n='cxlvii'/><anchor id='Pgcxlvii'/>

<p>
And yet the moment we attempt to leave the daylight
of consciousness for the darker sides of sub-conscious
life, the risks of misinterpretation multiply. The problem
is to some extent the same as confronts the student
of the ideas and principles of primitive races. There,
the temptation of seeing things through the <q>spectacles
of civilisation</q> is almost irresistible. So in psychology
we are apt to import into the life of sensation and
feeling the distinctions and relations of subsequent
intellection. Nor is the difficulty lessened by Hegel's
method which deals with soul, sentiency, and consciousness
as grades or general characteristics in a developmental
advance. He borrows his illustrations from
many quarters, from morbid and anomalous states of
consciousness,&mdash;less from the cases of savages, children
and animals. These illustrations may be called a loose
induction. But it requires a much more powerful
instrument than mere induction to build up a scientific
system; a framework of general principle or theory is
the only basis on which to build theory by the allegation
of facts, however numerous. Yet in philosophic science,
which is systematised knowledge, all facts strictly so
described will find their place and be estimated at their
proper value.
</p>

<div>
<head>(i.) Primitive Sensibility.</head>

<p>
Psychology (with Hegel) takes up the work of science
from biology. The mind comes before it as the supreme
product of the natural world, the finest flower of organic
life, the <q>truth</q> of the physical process. As such it is
called by the time-honoured name of Soul. If we
further go on to say that the soul is the principle of life,
<pb n='cxlviii'/><anchor id='Pgcxlviii'/>
we must not understand this vital principle to be something
over and above the life of which it is the principle.
Such a locally-separable principle is an addition which
is due to the analogy of mechanical movement, where
a detached agent sets in motion and directs the
machinery. But in the organism the principle is not
thus detachable as a thing or agent. By calling Soul
the principle of life we rather mean that in the vital
organism, so far as it <emph>lives</emph>, all the real variety, separation,
and discontinuity of parts must be reduced to unity
and identity, or as Hegel would say, to <emph>ideality</emph>. To
live is thus to keep all differences fluid and permeable
in the fire of the life-process. Or to use a familiar term
of logic, the Soul is the concept or intelligible unity
of the organic body. But to call it a concept might
suggest that it is only the conception through which <emph>we</emph>
represent to ourselves the variety in unity of the organism.
The soul, however, is more than a mere concept:
and life is more than a mere mode of description for
a group of movements forming an objective unity. It
is a unity, subjective and objective. The organism is
one life, controlling difference: and it is also one by
our effort to comprehend it. The Soul therefore is
in Hegelian language described as the Idea rather than
the concept of the organic body. Life is the generic
title for this subject-object: but the life may be merely
physical, or it may be intellectual and practical, or it
may be absolute, i.e. will and know all that it is, and be
all that it knows and wills.
</p>

<p>
Up to this point the world is what is called an
external, which is here taken to mean (not a world
external to the individual, but) a self-externalised world.
That is to say, it is the observer who has hitherto by
his interpretation of his perceptions supplied the <q>Spirit
in Nature.</q> In itself the external world has no inside,
<pb n='cxlix'/><anchor id='Pgcxlix'/>
no centre: it is we who read into it the conception of
a life-history. We are led to believe that a principle
of unity is always at work throughout the physical
world&mdash;even in the mathematical laws of natural operation.
It is only intelligible and credible to us as
a system, a continuous and regular development. But
that system is only a hypothetical idea, though it is held
to be a conclusion to which all the evidence seems
unequivocally to point. And, even in organic life, the
unity, though more perfect and palpable than in the
mechanical and inorganic world, is only a perception,
a vision,&mdash;a necessary mode of realising the unity of
the facts. The phenomenon of life reveals as in a picture
and an ocular demonstration the conformity of
inward and outward, the identity of whole and parts,
of power and utterance. But it is still outside the
observer. In the function of sensibility and sentiency,
however, we stand as it were on the border-line between
biology and psychology. At one step we have been
brought within the harmony, and are no longer mere
observers and reflecters. The sentient not merely is,
but is aware that it is. Hitherto as life, it only is the
unity in diversity, and diversity in unity, for the outsider,
i.e. only implicitly: now it is so for itself, or
consciously. And in the first stage it does not know,
but feels or is sentient. Here, for the first time, is
created the distinction of inward and outward. Loosely
indeed we may, like Mr. Spencer, speak of outward
and inward in physiology: but strictly speaking, what
Goethe says is true, <foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Natur hat weder Kern noch Schaale</foreign><note place='foot'>Cf. <hi rend='italic'>The Logic of Hegel</hi>, notes &amp;c., p. 421.</note>.
Nature in the narrower sense knows no distinction of
the inward and outward in its phenomena: it is a purely
superficial order and succession of appearance and
event. The Idea which has been visible to an intelligent
<pb n='cl'/><anchor id='Pgcl'/>
percipient in the types and laws of the natural
world, now <emph>is</emph>, actually is&mdash;is in and for itself&mdash;but
at first in a minimum of content, a mere point of light,
or rather the dawn which has yet to expand into the
full day.
</p>

<p>
Spinoza has asserted that <q>all individual bodies are
animate, though in different degrees<note place='foot'><q>Omnia individua corpora quamvis diversis gradibus animata
sunt.</q> <hi rend='italic'>Eth.</hi> ii. 13. schol.</note>.</q> Now it is to
a great extent this diversity of degree on which the
main interest turns. Yet it is well to remember that
the abrupt and trenchant separations which popular
practice loves are overridden to a deeper view by an
essential unity of idea, reducing them to indifference.
If, that is, we take seriously the Spinozist unity of
Substance, and the continual correlation (to call it no
more) of extension and consciousness therein, we cannot
avoid the conclusion which even Bacon would
admit of something describable as attraction and perception,
something subduing diversity to unity. But
whether it be well to name this soul or life is a different
matter. It may indeed only be taken to mean that all
true being must be looked on as a real unity and individuality,
must, that is, be conceived as manifesting
itself in organisation, must be referred to a self-centred
and self-developing activity. But this&mdash;which is the
fundamental thesis of idealism&mdash;is hardly all that is
meant. Rather Spinoza would imply that all things
which form a real unity must have life&mdash;must have
inner principle and unifying reality: and what he
teaches is closely akin to the Leibnitian doctrine that
every substantial existence reposes upon a monad,
a unity which is at once both a force and a cognition,
a <q>representation</q> and an appetite or <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>nisus</foreign> to act.
<pb n='cli'/><anchor id='Pgcli'/>
When Fechner in a series of works<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Nanna</hi> (1848): <hi rend='italic'>Zendavesta</hi> (1851): <hi rend='italic'>Ueber die Seelenfrage</hi> (1861).</note> expounds and
defends the hypothesis that plants and planets are not
destitute of soul, any more than man and animals,
he only gives a more pronounced expression to this
idealisation or spiritualisation of the natural world.
But for the moment the point to be noted is that all
of this idealistic doctrine is an inference, or a development
which finds its <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>point d'appui</foreign> in the fact of sensation.
And the problem of the Philosophy of Mind is
just to trace the process whereby a mere shock of
sensation has grown into a conception and a faith in the
goodness, beauty and intelligence of the world.
</p>

<p>
Schopenhauer has put the point with his usual picturesqueness.
Outward nature presents nothing but a
play of forces. At first, however, this force shows
merely the mechanical phenomena of pressure and
impact, and its theory is sufficiently described by mathematical
physics. But in the process of nature force
assumes higher types, types where it loses a certain
amount of its externality<note place='foot'>Described by S. as the rise from mere physical <emph>cause</emph> to physiological
<emph>stimulus</emph> (Reiz), to psychical <emph>motive</emph>.</note>, till in the organic world it
acquires a peculiar phase which Schopenhauer calls
<emph>Will</emph>, meaning by that, however, an organising and controlling
power, a tendency or <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>nisus</foreign> to be and live, which
is persistent and potent, but without consciousness.
This blind force, which however has a certain coherence
and purposiveness, is in the animal organism
endowed with a new character, in consequence of the
emergence of a new organ. This organ, the brain and
nervous system, causes the evolution into clear day of
an element which has been growing more and more
urgent. The gathering tendency of force to return
into itself is now complete: the cycle of operation is
<pb n='clii'/><anchor id='Pgclii'/>
formed: and the junction of the two currents issues
in the spark of sensation. The blind force now becomes
seeing.
</p>

<p>
But at first&mdash;and this is the point we have to emphasise&mdash;its
powers of vision are limited. Sensibility is
either a local and restricted phenomenon: or, in so
far as it is not local, it is vague and indefinite, and
hardly entitled to the name of sensibility. Either it
is a dim, but far-reaching, sympathy with environing
existence, and in that case only so-called blind will or
feeling: or if it is clear, is locally confined, and at
first within very narrow limits. Neither of these points
must be lost sight of. On the one hand feeling has
to be regarded as the dull and confused stirring of an
almost infinite sympathy with the world&mdash;a pulse which
has come from the far-distant movements of the universe,
and bears with it, if but as a possibility, the
wealth of an infinite message. On the other hand,
feeling at first only becomes real, in this boundless
ideality to which its possibilities extend, by restricting
itself to one little point and from several points organising
itself to a unity of bodily feeling, till it can go on
from thence to embrace the universe in distinct and
articulate comprehension.
</p>

<p>
Soul, says Hegel, is not a separate and additional
something over and above the rest of nature: it is
rather nature's <q>'universal immaterialism, and simple
ideal life<note place='foot'>Infra, p. <ref target='Pg012'>12</ref>.</note>.</q> There were ancient philosophers who spoke
of the soul as a self-adjusting number,&mdash;as a harmony,
or equilibrium<note place='foot'>Aristot., <hi rend='italic'>De Anima</hi>, i. c. 4, 5.</note>&mdash;and the moderns have added considerably
to the list of these analogical definitions.
As definitions they obviously fall short. Yet these
things give, as it were, by anticipation, an image of
soul, as the <q>ideality,</q> which reduces the manifold to
<pb n='cliii'/><anchor id='Pgcliii'/>
unity. The adhesions and cohesions of matter, its
gravitating attractions, its chemical affinities and electrical
polarities, the intricate out-and-in of organic structure,
are all preludes to the true incorporating unity
which is the ever-immanent supersession of the endless
self-externalism and successionalism of physical reality.
But in sentiency, feeling, or sensibility, the unity which
all of these imply without reaching, is explicitly present.
It is implicitly an all-embracing unity: an infinite,&mdash;which
has no doors and no windows, for the good
reason that it needs none, because it has nothing outside
it, because it <q>expresses</q> and <q>envelopes</q> (however
confusedly at first) the whole universe. Thus,
even if, with localising phraseology, we may describe
mind, where it <emph>appears</emph> emerging in the natural world,
as a mere feeble and incidental outburst,&mdash;a rebellion
breaking out as in some petty province or isolated region
against the great law of the physical realm&mdash;we are in
so speaking taking only an external standpoint. But
with the rise of mind in nature the bond of externalism
is implicitly overcome. To it, and where it really is,
there is nothing outside, nothing transcendent. Everything
which is said to be outside mind is only outside
a localised and limited mind&mdash;outside a mind which is
imperfectly and abstractly realised&mdash;not outside mind
absolutely. Mind is the absolute negation of externality:
not a mere relative negative, as the organism
may be biologically described as inner in respect of the
environment. To accomplish this negation in actuality, to
bring the multiplicity and externality of things into the
unity and identity of one Idea, is the process of development
of mind from animal sensibility to philosophic
knowledge, from appetite to art,&mdash;the process of culture
through the social state under the influence of religion.
</p>

<p>
Sentiency or psychic matter (mind-stuff), to begin
<pb n='cliv'/><anchor id='Pgcliv'/>
with, is in some respects like the <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>tabula rasa</foreign> of the
empiricists. It is the possibility&mdash;but the real possibility&mdash;of
intelligence rather than intelligence itself. It
is the monotonous undifferentiated inwardness&mdash;a faint
self-awareness and self-realisation of the material world,
but at first a mere vague <emph>psychical protoplasm</emph> and without
defined nucleus, without perceptible organisation or
separation of structures. If there is self-awareness, it
is not yet discriminated into a distinct and unified self,
not yet differentiated and integrated,&mdash;soul in the condition
of a mere <q>Is,</q> which, however, is nothing determinate.
It is very much in the situation of Condillac's
statue-man&mdash;<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>une statue organisée intérieurement comme
nous, et animée d'un esprit privé de toute espèce d'idées</foreign>:
alike at least so far that the rigid uniformity of the
latter's envelope prevents all articulated organisation
of its faculties. The foundation under all the diversity
and individuality in the concrete intelligent and volitional
life is a common feeling,&mdash;a <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>sensus communis</foreign>&mdash;a
general and indeterminate susceptibility to influence,
a sympathy responsive, but responsive vaguely
and equivocally, to all the stimuli of the physical environment.
There was once a time, according to primitive
legend, when man understood the language of
beast and bird, and even surprised the secret converse
of trees and flowers. Such fancies are but the exaggeration
of a solidarity of conscious life which seems to
spread far in the sub-conscious realm, and to narrow the
individual's soul into limited channels as it rises into
clear self-perception,

It may be a mere dream that, as Goethe feigns of
Makaria in his romance<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Wilhelm Meister's Wanderjahre</hi>, i. 10.</note>, there are men and women in
<pb n='clv'/><anchor id='Pgclv'/>
sympathy with the vicissitudes of the starry regions:
and hypotheses of lunar influence, or dogmas of astrological
destiny, may count to the present guardians of
the sciences as visionary superstitions. Yet science in
these regions has no reason to be dogmatic; her function
hitherto can only be critical; and even for that, her
data are scanty and her principles extremely general.
The influences on the mental mood and faculty, produced
by climate and seasons, by local environment and
national type, by individual peculiarities, by the differences
of age and sex, and by the alternation of night
and day, of sleep and waking, are less questionable.
It is easy no doubt to ignore or forget them: easy to
remark how indefinable and incalculable they are. But
that does not lessen their radical and inevitable impress
in the determination of the whole character. <q>The
sum of our existence, divided by reason, never comes
out exact, but always leaves a marvellous remainder<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Wilhelm Meister's Wanderjahre</hi>, iv. 18.</note>.</q>
Irrational this residue is, in the sense that it is inexplicable,
and incommensurable with the well-known
quantities of conscious and voluntarily organised life.
But a scientific psychology, which is adequate to the
real and concrete mind, should never lose sight of the
fact that every one of its propositions in regard to the
more advanced phases of intellectual development is
thoroughly and in indefinable ways modified by these
preconditions. When that is remembered, it will be
obvious how complicated is the problem of adapting
psychology for the application to education, and how
dependent the solution of that problem is upon an
experiential familiarity with the data of individual and
national temperament and character.
</p>

<p>
The first stage in mental development is the establishment
of regular and uniform relations between soul and
<pb n='clvi'/><anchor id='Pgclvi'/>
body: it is the differentiation of organs and the integration
of function: the balance between sensation and
movement, between the afferent and efferent processes
of sensitivity. Given a potential soul, the problem is to
make it actual in an individual body. It is the business
of a physical psychology to describe in detail the steps
by which the body we are attached to is made inward
as our idea through the several organs and their
nervous appurtenances: whereas a psychical physiology
would conversely explain the corresponding processes
for the expression of the emotions and for the objectification
of the volitions. Thus soul inwardises (<foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>erinnert</foreign>)
or envelops body: which body <q>expresses</q> or develops
soul. The actual soul is the unity of both, is the
percipient individual. The solidarity or <q>communion</q>
of body and soul is here the dominant fact: the soul
sentient of changes in its peripheral organs, and transmitting
emotion and volition into physical effect. It is
on this psychical unity,&mdash;the unity which is the soul of
the diversity of body&mdash;that all the subsequent developments
of mind rest. Sensation is thus the <foreign rend='italic'>prius</foreign>&mdash;or
basis&mdash;of all mental life: the organisation of soul in
body and of body in soul. It is the process which
historically has been prepared in the evolution of animal
life from those undifferentiated forms where specialised
organs are yet unknown, and which each individual
has further to realise and complete for himself, by
learning to see and hear, and use his limbs. At first,
moreover, it begins from many separate centres and
only through much collision and mutual compliance
arrives at comparative uniformity and centralisation.
The common basis of united sensibility supplied by
the one organism has to be made real and effective,
and it is so at first by sporadic and comparatively independent
developments. If self-hood means reference
<pb n='clvii'/><anchor id='Pgclvii'/>
to self of what is prima facie not self, and projection of
self therein, there is in primitive sensibility only the
germ or possibility of self-hood. In the early phases of
psychic development the centre is fluctuating and ill-defined,
and it takes time and trouble to co-ordinate or
unify the various starting-points of sensibility<note place='foot'>Works like Preyer's <hi rend='italic'>Seele des Kindes</hi> illustrate this aspect of
mental evolution; its acquirement of definite and correlated functions.</note>.
</p>

<p>
This consolidation of inward life may be looked at
either formally or concretely. Under the first head, it
means the growth of a central unity of apperception.
In the second case, it means a peculiar aggregate of
ideas and sentiments. There is growing up within him
what we may call the individuality of the individual,&mdash;an
irrational, i.e. not consciously intelligent, nether-self
or inner soul, a firm aggregation of hopes and
wishes, of views and feelings, or rather of tendencies
and temperament, of character hereditary and acquired.
It is the law of the natural will or character which from
an inaccessible background dominates our action,&mdash;which,
because it is not realised and formulated in consciousness,
behaves like a guardian spirit, or genius, or
destiny within us. This genius is the sub-conscious unity
of the sensitive life&mdash;the manner of man which unknown
to ourselves we are,&mdash;and which influences us against
our nominal or formal purposes. So far as this predominates,
our ends, rough hew them how we will, are
given by a force which is not really, i.e. with full
consciousness, ours: by a mass of ingrained prejudice
and unreasoned sympathies, of instincts and passions,
of fancies and feelings, which have condensed and
organised themselves into a natural power. As the
child in the mother's womb is responsive to her psychic
influences, so the development of a man's psychic
life is guided by feelings centred in objects and agents
<pb n='clviii'/><anchor id='Pgclviii'/>
external to him, who form the genius presiding over his
development. His soul, to that extent, is really in
another: he himself is selfless, and when his stay is
removed the principle of his life is gone<note place='foot'>Cf. the end of Caleb Balderstone (in <hi rend='italic'>The Bride of Lammermoor</hi>):
<q>With a fidelity sometimes displayed by the canine race, but seldom
by human beings, he pined and died.</q></note>. He is but
a bundle of impressions, held together by influences and
ties which in years before consciousness proper began
made him what he is. Such is the involuntary adaptation
to example and environment, which establishes in the
depths below personality a self which becomes hereafter
the determinant of action. Early years, in which the
human being is naturally susceptible, build up by
imitation, by pliant obedience, an image, a system,
reproducing the immediate surroundings. The soul,
as yet selfless, and ready to accept any imprint, readily
moulds itself into the likeness of an authoritative
influence.
</p>

<p>
The step by which the universality or unity of the
self is realised in the variety of its sensation is Habit.
Habit gives us a definite standing-ground in the flux of
single impressions: it is the identification of ourselves
with what is most customary and familiar: an identification
which takes place by practice and repetition. If it
circumscribes us to one little province of being, it on
the other frees us from the vague indeterminateness
where we are at the mercy of every passing mood. It
makes thus much of our potential selves our very own,
our acquisition and permanent possession. It, above all,
makes us free and at one with our bodily part, so that
henceforth we start as a subjective unit of body and
soul. We have now as the result of the anthropological
process a self or ego, an individual consciousness able
to reflect and compare, setting itself on one side (a soul
<pb n='clix'/><anchor id='Pgclix'/>
in bodily organisation), and on the other setting an
object of consciousness, or external world, a world of
other things. All this presupposes that the soul has
actualised itself by appropriating and acquiring as its
expression and organ the physical sensibility which
is its body. By restricting and establishing itself, it
has gained a fixed standpoint. No doubt it has localised
and confined itself, but it is no longer at the disposal
of externals and accident: it has laid the foundation
for higher developments.

<head>(ii.) Anomalies of Psychical Life.</head>

<p>
Psychology, as we have seen, goes for information
regarding the earlier stages of mental growth to the
child and the animal,&mdash;perhaps also to the savage. So
too sociology founds certain conclusions upon the observations
of savage customs and institutions, or on the
earlier records of the race. In both cases with a limitation
caused by the externality and fragmentariness of
the facts and the need of interpreting them through our
own conscious experiences. There is however another
direction in which corresponding inquiries may be pursued;
and where the danger of the conclusions arrived
at, though not perhaps less real, is certainly of a different
kind. In sociology we can observe&mdash;and almost
experiment upon&mdash;the phenomena of the lapsed, degenerate
and criminal classes. The advantage of such
observation is that the object of study can be made to
throw greater light on his own inner states. He is
a little of the child and a little of the savage, but these
aspects co-exist with other features which put him more
on a level with the intelligent observer. Similar pathological
<pb n='clx'/><anchor id='Pgclx'/>
regions are open to us in the case of psychology.
There the anomalous and morbid conditions of mind
co-exist with a certain amount of mature consciousness.
So presented, they are thrown out into relief. They
form the negative instances which serve to corroborate
our positive inductions. The regularly concatenated
and solid structure of normal mind is under abnormal
and deranged conditions thrown into disorder, and its
constituents are presented in their several isolation.
Such phenomena are relapses into more rudimentary
grades: but with the difference that they are set in the
midst of a more advanced phase of intellectual life.
</p>

<p>
Even amongst candid and honest-minded students of
psychology there is a certain reluctance to dabble in
researches into the night-side of the mental range.
Herbart is an instance of this shrinking. The region
of the Unconscious seemed&mdash;and to many still seems&mdash;a
region in which the charlatan and the dupe can and
must play into each other's hands. Once in the whirl
of spiritualist and crypto-psychical inquiry you could
not tell how far you might be carried. The facts moreover
were of a peculiar type. Dependent as they seemed
to be on the frame of mind of observers and observed,
they defied the ordinary criteria of detached and
abstract observation. You can only observe them, it
is urged, when you believe; scepticism destroys them.
Now there is a widespread natural impatience against
what Bacon has called <q>monodical</q> phenomena, phenomena
i.e. which claim to come under a special law
of their own, or to have a private and privileged sphere.
And this impatience cuts the Gordian knot by a determination
to treat all instances which oppose its hitherto
ascertained laws as due to deception and fraud, or,
at the best, to incompetent observation, confusions of
memory, and superstitions of ignorance. Above all,
<pb n='clxi'/><anchor id='Pgclxi'/>
great interests of religion and personality seemed to
connect themselves with these revelations&mdash;interests, at
any rate, to which our common humanity thrills; it
seemed as if, in this region beyond the customary range
of the conscious and the seen, one might learn something
of the deeper realities which lie in the unseen.
But to feel that so much was at stake was naturally
unfavourable to purely dispassionate observation.
</p>

<p>
The philosophers were found&mdash;as might have been
expected&mdash;amongst those most strongly attracted by
these problems. Even Kant had been fascinated by
the spiritualism of Swedenborg, though he finally turned
away sceptical. At least as early as 1806 Schelling had
been interested by Ritter's researches into the question
of telepathy, or the power of the human will to produce
without mechanical means of conveyance an effect at
a distance. He was looking forward to the rise of
a <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>Physica coelestis</foreign>, or New Celestial Physics, which
should justify the old magic. About the same date his
brother Karl published an essay on Animal Magnetism.
The novel phenomena of galvanism and its congeners
suggested vast possibilities in the range of the physical
powers, especially of the physical powers of the
human psyche as a natural agent. The divining-rod
was revived. Clairvoyance and somnambulism were
carefully studied, and the curative powers of animal
magnetism found many advocates<note place='foot'>See Windischmann's letters in <hi rend='italic'>Briefe von und an Hegel</hi>.</note>.
</p>

<p>
Interest in these questions went naturally with the
new conception of the place of Man in Nature, and
of Nature as the matrix of mind<note place='foot'>Cf. <hi rend='italic'>Prolegomena to the Study of Hegel</hi>, chaps. xii-xiv.</note>. But it had been
acutely stimulated by the performances and professions
of Mesmer at Vienna and Paris in the last quarter of
the eighteenth century. These&mdash;though by no means
<pb n='clxii'/><anchor id='Pgclxii'/>
really novel&mdash;had forced the artificial world of science
and fashion to discuss the claim advanced for a new
force which, amongst other things, could cure ailments
that baffled the ordinary practitioner. This new force&mdash;mainly
because of the recent interest in the remarkable
advances of magnetic and electrical research&mdash;was conceived
as a fluid, and called Animal Magnetism. At
one time indeed Mesmer actually employed a magnet
in the manipulation by which he induced the peculiar
condition in his patients. The accompaniments of his
procedure were in many respects those of the quack-doctor;
and with the quack indeed he was often classed.
A French commission of inquiry appointed to examine
into his performances reported in 1784 that, while there
was no doubt as to the reality of many of the phenomena,
and even of the cures, there was no evidence for the
alleged new physical force, and declared the effects to
be mainly attributable to the influence of imagination.
And with the mention of this familiar phrase, further
explanation was supposed to be rendered superfluous.
</p>

<p>
In France political excitement allowed the mesmeric
theory and practice to drop out of notice till the fall
of the first Empire. But in Germany there was a considerable
amount of investigations and hypotheses into
these mystical phenomena, though rarely by the ordinary
routine workers in the scientific field. The phenomena
where they were discussed were studied and interpreted
in two directions. Some theorists, like Jung-Stilling,
Eschenmayer, Schubert, and Kerner, took the more
metaphysicist and spiritualistic view: they saw in them
the witness to a higher truth, to the presence and operation
in this lower world of a higher and spiritual matter,
a so-called ether. Thus Animal Magnetism supplied
a sort of physical theory of the other world and the
other life. Jung-Stilling, e.g. in his <q>Theory of Spirit-lore.</q>
<pb n='clxiii'/><anchor id='Pgclxiii'/>
(1808), regarded the spiritualistic phenomena as
a justification of&mdash;what he believed to be&mdash;the Kantian
doctrine that in the truly real and persistent world space
and time are no more. The other direction of inquiry
kept more to the physical field. Ritter (whose researches
interested both Schelling and Hegel) supposed he had
detected the new force underlying mesmerism and the
like, and gave to it the name of Siderism (1808); while
Amoretti of Milan named the object of his experiments
Animal Electrometry (1816). Kieser<note place='foot'>Kieser's <hi rend='italic'>Tellurismus</hi> is, according to Schopenhauer, <q>the fullest
and most thorough text-book of Animal Magnetism.</q></note>, again (1826) spoke
of Tellurism, and connected animal magnetism with the
play of general terrestrial forces in the human being.
</p>

<p>
At a later date (1857) Schindler, in his <q>Magical
Spirit-life,</q> expounded a theory of mental polarity.
The psychical life has two poles or centres,&mdash;its day-pole,
around which revolves our ordinary and superficial
current of ideas, and its night-pole, round which gathers
the sub-conscious and deeper group of beliefs and
sentiments. Either life has a memory, a consciousness,
a world of its own: and they flourish to a large
extent inversely to each other. The day-world has
for its organs of receiving information the ordinary
senses. But the magical or night-world of the soul has
its feelers also, which set men directly in telepathic
rapport with influences, however distant, exerted by the
whole world: and through this <q>inner sense</q> which
serves to concentrate in itself all the telluric forces
(&mdash;a sense which in its various aspects we name
instinct, presentiment, conscience) is constructed the
fabric of our sub-conscious system. Through it man is
a sort of résumé of all the cosmic life, in secret affinity
and sympathy with all natural processes; and by the
will which stands in response therewith he can exercise
<pb n='clxiv'/><anchor id='Pgclxiv'/>
a directly creative action on external nature. In
normal and healthy conditions the two currents of
psychic life run on harmonious but independent. But
in the phenomena of somnambulism, clairvoyance, and
delirium, the magic region becomes preponderant, and
comes into collision with the other. The dark-world
emerges into the realm of day as a portentous power:
and there is the feeling of a double personality, or of an
indwelling genius, familiar spirit, or demon.
</p>

<p>
To the ordinary physicist the so-called <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>Actio in
distans</foreign> was a hopeless stumbling-block. If he did not
comprehend the transmission (as it is called) of force
where there was immediate contact, he was at least
perfectly familiar with the outer aspect of it as a
condition of his limited experience. It needed one
beyond the mere hodman of science to say with
Laplace: <q>We are so far from knowing all the agents
of nature, that it would be very unphilosophical to deny
the existence of phenomena solely because they are
inexplicable in the present state of our knowledge.</q>
Accordingly mesmerism and its allied manifestations
were generally abandoned to the bohemians of science,
and to investigators with dogmatic bias. It was still
employed as a treatment for certain ailments: and
philosophers, as different as Fichte and Schopenhauer<note place='foot'>Cf. Fichte, <hi rend='italic'>Nachgelassene Werke</hi>, iii. 295 (<hi rend='italic'>Tagebuch über den
animalischen Magnetismus</hi>, 1813), and Schopenhauer, <hi rend='italic'>Der Wille in
der Natur</hi>.</note>,
watched its fate with attention. But the herd of
professional scientists fought shy of it. The experiments
of Braid at Manchester in 1841 gradually helped
to give research into the subject a new character.
Under the name of Hypnotism (or, rather at first
Neuro-hypnotism) he described the phenomena of the
magnetic sleep (induced through prolonged staring at
<pb n='clxv'/><anchor id='Pgclxv'/>
a bright object), such as abnormal rigidity of body,
perverted sensibility, and the remarkable obedience
of the subject to the command or suggestions of the
operator. Thirty years afterwards, the matter became
an object of considerable experimental and theoretic
work in France, at the rival schools of Paris and
Nancy; and the question, mainly under the title of
hypnotism, though the older name is still occasionally
heard, has been for several years brought prominently
under public notice.
</p>

<p>
It cannot be said that the net results of these observations
and hypotheses are of a very definitive character.
While a large amount of controversy has been waged
on the comparative importance of the several methods
and instruments by which the hypnotic or mesmeric
trance may be induced, and a scarcely less wide range
of divergence prevails with regard to the physiological
and pathological conditions in connexion with which it
has been most conspicuously manifested, there has been
less anxiety shown to determine its precise psychical
nature, or its significance in mental development. And
yet the better understanding of these aspects may
throw light on several points connected with primitive
religion and the history of early civilisation, indeed over
the whole range of what is called <foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Völkerpsychologie</foreign>.
Indeed this is one of the points which may be said
to emerge out of the confusion of dispute. Phenomena
at least analogous to those styled hypnotic have
a wide range in the anthropological sphere<note place='foot'>Bernheim: <hi rend='italic'>La suggestion domine toute l'histoire de l'humanité</hi>.</note>: and the
proper characters which belong to them will only be
caught by an observer who examines them in the
widest variety of examples. Another feature which has
been put in prominence is what has been called <q>psychological
automatism.</q> And in this name two points
<pb n='clxvi'/><anchor id='Pgclxvi'/>
seem to deserve note. The first is the spontaneous
and as it were mechanical consecution of mental states
in the soul whence the interfering effect of voluntary
consciousness has been removed. And the second is the
unfailing or accurate regularity, so contrary to the
hesitating and uncertain procedure of our conscious
and reasoned action, which so often is seen in the
unreflecting and unreasoned movements. To this
invariable sequence of psychical movement the superior
control and direction by the intelligent self has to adapt
itself, just as it respects the order of physical laws.
</p>

<p>
But, perhaps, the chief conclusion to be derived from
hypnotic experience is the value of suggestion or
suggestibility. Even cool thinkers like Kant have
recognised how much mere mental control has to do
with bodily state,&mdash;how each of us, in this way, is often
for good or for ill his own physician. An idea is a force,
and is only inactive in so far as it is held in check by
other ideas. <q>There is no such thing as hypnotism,</q>
says one: <q>there are only different degrees of suggestibility.</q>
This may be to exaggerate: yet it serves to
impress the comparatively secondary character of many
of the circumstances on which the specially mesmeric
or hypnotic experimentalist is apt to lay exclusive stress.
The methods may probably vary according to circumstances.
But the essence of them all is to get the
patient out of the general frame and system of ideas
and perceptions in which his ordinary individuality is
encased. Considering how for all of us the reality of
concrete life is bound up with our visual perceptions,
how largely our sanity depends upon the spatial idea,
and how that depends on free ocular range, we
can understand that darkness and temporary loss
of vision are powerful auxiliaries in the hypnotic
process, as in magical and superstitious rites. But
<pb n='clxvii'/><anchor id='Pgclxvii'/>
a great deal short of this may serve to establish
influence. The mind of the majority of human beings,
but especially of the young, may be compared to
a vacant seat waiting for some one to fill it.
</p>

<p>
In Hegel's view hypnotic phenomena produce a kind
of temporary and artificial atavism. Mechanical or
chemical means, or morbid conditions of body, may
cause even for the intelligent adult a relapse into
states of mind closely resembling those exhibited by
the primitive or the infantile sensibility. The intelligent
personality, where powers are bound up with
limitations and operate through a chain of means and
ends, is reduced to its primitively undifferentiated
condition. Not that it is restored to its infantile
simplicity; but that all subsequent acquirements operate
only as a concentrated individuality, or mass of will
and character, released from the control of the self-possessed
mind, and invested (by the latter's withdrawal)
with a new quasi-personality of their own.
With the loss of the world of outward things, there
may go, it is supposed, a clearer perception of the
inward and particularly of the organic life. The Soul
contains the form of unity which other experiences had
impressed upon it: but this form avails in its subterranean
existence where it creates a sort of inner self.
And this inner self is no longer, like the embodied self
of ordinary consciousness, an intelligence served by
organs, and proceeding by induction and inference.
Its knowledge is not mediated or carried along specific
channels: it does not build up, piecemeal, by successive
steps of synthesis and analysis, by gradual idealisation,
the organised totality of its intellectual world. The
somnambulist and the clairvoyant see without eyes, and
carry their vision directly into regions where the waking
consciousness of orderly intelligence cannot enter.
<pb n='clxviii'/><anchor id='Pgclxviii'/>
But that region is not the world of our higher ideas,&mdash;of
art, religion, and philosophy. It is still the sensitivity&mdash;that
realm of sensitivity which is ordinarily covered by
unconsciousness. Such sensitive clairvoyants may, as
it were, hear themselves growing; they may discern the
hidden quivers and pulses of blood and tissue, the seats
of secret pain and all the unrevealed workings in the
dark chambers of the flesh. But always their vision
seems confined to that region, and will fall short of the
world of light and ideal truth. It is towards the nature-bond
of sensitive solidarity with earth, and flowers, and
trees, the life that <q>rolls through all things,</q> not towards
the spiritual unity which broods over the world and
<q>impels all thinking things,</q> that these immersions in
the selfless universe lead us.
</p>

<p>
What Hegel chiefly sees in these phenomena is their
indication, even on the natural side of man, of that
ideality of the material, which it is the work of intelligence
to produce in the more spiritual life, in the
fully-developed mind. The latter is the supreme over-soul,
that Absolute Mind which in our highest moods,
aesthetic and religious, we approximate to. But mind,
as it tends towards the higher end to <q>merge itself in
light,</q> to identify itself yet not wholly lost, but retained,
in the fullness of undivided intellectual being, so at the
lower end it springs from a natural and underlying
unity, the immense solidarity of nether-soul, the great
Soul of Nature&mdash;the <q>Substance</q> which is to be raised
into the <q>Subject</q> which is true divinity. Between
these two unities, the nature-given nether-soul and
the spirit-won over-soul, lies the conscious life of
man: a process of differentiation which narrows and
of redintegration which enlarges,&mdash;which alternately
builds up an isolated personality and dissolves it in
a common intelligence and sympathy. It is because
<pb n='clxix'/><anchor id='Pgclxix'/>
mental or tacit <q>suggestion</q><note place='foot'>An instance from an unexpected quarter, in Eckermann's conversations
with Goethe: <q>In my young days I have experienced
cases enough, where on lonely walks there came over me a powerful
yearning for a beloved girl, and I thought of her so long till she
actually came to meet me.</q> (Conversation of Oct. 7, 1827.)</note> (i.e. will-influence
exercised without word or sign, or other sensible
mode of connexion), thought-transference, or thought-reading
(which is more than dexterous apprehension of
delicate muscular signs), exteriorisation or transposition
of sensibility into objects primarily non-sensitive,
clairvoyance (i.e. the power of describing, as if
from direct perception, objects or events removed
in space beyond the recognised limits of sensation),
and somnambulism, so far as it implies lucid vision with
sealed eyes,&mdash;it is because these things seem to show
the essential ideality of matter, that Hegel is interested
in them. The ordinary conditions of consciousness
and even of practical life in society are a derivative and
secondary state; a product of processes of individualism,
which however are never completed, and leave a large
margin for idealising intelligence to fulfil. From a state
which is not yet personality to a state which is more
than can be described as personality&mdash;lies the mental
movement. So Fichte, too, had regarded the power of
the somnambulist as laying open a world underlying
the development of egoity and self-consciousness<note place='foot'><foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Gleichsam in einer Vorwelt, einer diese Welt schaffenden Welt</foreign>
(<hi rend='italic'>Nachgelassene Werke</hi>, iii. 321).</note>: <q>the
merely sensuous man is still in somnambulism,</q> only
a somnambulism of waking hours: <q>the true waking is
the life in God, to be free in him, all else is sleep and
dream.</q> <q>Egoity,</q> he adds, <q>is a merely <emph>formal</emph> principle,
utterly, and never qualitative (i.e. the essence and
universal force).</q> For Schopenhauer, too, the experiences
of animal magnetism had seemed to prove the
<pb n='clxx'/><anchor id='Pgclxx'/>
absolute supernatural power of the radical will in its
superiority to the intellectual categories of space, time,
and causal sequence: to prove the reality of the metaphysical
which is at the basis of all conscious divisions.

<div>
<head>(iii.) The Development of Inner Freedom.</head>

<p>
The result of the first range in the process of psycho-genesis
was to make the body a sign and utterance of
the Soul, with a fixed and determinate type. The
<q>anthropological process</q> has defined and settled the
mere general sentiency of soul into an individualised
shape, a localised and limited self, a bundle of habits.
It has made the soul an Ego or self: a power which
looks out upon the world as a spectator, lifted above
immanence in the general tide of being, but only so
lifted because it has made itself one in the world of
objects, a thing among things. The Mind has reached
the point of view of reflection. Instead of a general
identifiability with all nature, it has encased itself in
a limited range, from which it looks forth on what is
now other than itself. If previously it was mere inward
sensibility, it is now sense, perceptive of an object here
and now, of an external world. The step has involved
some price: and that price is, that it has attained independence
and self-hood at the cost of surrendering the
content it had hitherto held in one with itself. It is
now a blank receptivity, open to the impressions of an
outside world: and the changes which take place in its
process of apprehension seem to it to be given from
outside. The world it perceives is a world of isolated
and independent objects: and it takes them as they
<pb n='clxxi'/><anchor id='Pgclxxi'/>
are given. But a closer insistance on the perception
develops the implicit intelligence, which makes it possible.
The percipient mind is no mere recipiency or
susceptibility with its forms of time and space: it is
spontaneously active, it is the source of categories, or is
an apperceptive power,&mdash;an understanding. Consciousness,
thus discovered to be a creative or constructive
faculty, is strictly speaking self-consciousness<note place='foot'><foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Selbst-bewusstsein</foreign> is not self-consciousness, in the vulgar sense
of brooding over feelings and self: but consciousness which is active
and outgoing, rather than receptive and passive. It is practical, as
opposed to theoretical.</note>.
</p>

<p>
Self-consciousness appears at first in the selfish or
narrowly egoistic form of appetite and impulse. The
intelligence which claims to mould and construe the
world of objects&mdash;which, in Kant's phrase, professes
to give us nature&mdash;is implicitly the lord of that world.
And that supremacy it carries out as appetite&mdash;as
destruction. The self is but a bundle of wants&mdash;its
supremacy over things is really subjection to them: the
satisfaction of appetite is baffled by a new desire which
leaves it as it was before. The development of self-consciousness
to a more adequate shape is represented
by Hegel as taking place through the social struggle
for existence. Human beings, too, are in the first
instance to the uninstructed appetite or the primitive
self-consciousness (which is simply a succession of individual
desires for satisfaction of natural want) only
things,&mdash;adjectival to that self's individual existence.
To them, too, his primary relation is to appropriate and
master them. Might precedes right. But the social
struggle for existence forces him to recognise something
other which is kindred to himself,&mdash;a limiting
principle, another self which has to form an element in
his calculations, not to be neglected. And gradually,
<pb n='clxxii'/><anchor id='Pgclxxii'/>
we may suppose, the result is the division of humanity
into two levels, a ruling lordly class, and a class of
slaves,&mdash;a state of inequality in which each knows that
his appetite is in some measure checked by a more or
less permanent other. Lastly, perhaps soonest in the
inferior order, there is fashioned the perception that its
self-seeking in its isolated appetites is subject to an
abiding authority, a continuing consciousness. There
grows up a social self&mdash;a sense of general humanity
and solidarity with other beings&mdash;a larger self with
which each identifies himself, a common ground.
Understanding was selfish intelligence: practical in the
egoistic sense. In the altruistic or universal sense
practical, a principle social and unifying character,
intelligence is Reason.
</p>

<p>
Thus, Man, beginning as a percipient consciousness,
apprehending single objects in space and time, and as
an appetitive self bent upon single gratifications, has
ended as a rational being,&mdash;a consciousness purged of
its selfishness and isolation, looking forward openly and
impartially on the universe of things and beings. He
has ceased to be a mere animal, swallowed up in the
moment and the individual, using his intelligence only
in selfish satisfactions. He is no longer bound down
by the struggle for existence, looking on everything as
a mere thing, a mere means. He has erected himself
above himself and above his environment, but that
because he occupies a point of view at which he and
his environment are no longer purely antithetical and
exclusive<note place='foot'>The more detailed exposition of this Phenomenology of Mind is
given in the book with that title: Hegel's <hi rend='italic'>Werke</hi>, ii. pp. 71-316.</note>. He has reached what is really the moral
standpoint: the point i.e. at which he is inspired by
a universal self-consciousness, and lives in that peaceful
world where the antitheses of individualities and of outward
<pb n='clxxiii'/><anchor id='Pgclxxiii'/>
and inward have ceased to trouble. <q>The natural
man,</q> says Hegel<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>System der Sittlichkeit</hi>, p. 15 (see Essay V).</note>, <q>sees in the woman flesh of his flesh:
the moral and spiritual man sees spirit of his spirit in the
moral and spiritual being and by its means.</q> Hitherto
we have been dealing with something falling below the
full truth of mind: the region of immediate sensibility
with its thorough immersion of mind in body, first of
all, and secondly its gradual progress to a general
standpoint. It is only in the third part of Subjective
mind that we are dealing with the psychology of a being
who in the human sense knows and wills, i.e. apprehends
general truth, and carries out ideal purposes.
</p>

<p>
Thus, for the third time, but now on a higher plane,
that of intelligence and rationality, is traced the process
of development or realisation by which reason becomes
reasoned knowledge and rational will, a free or autonomous
intelligence. And, as before, the starting-point,
alike in theoretical and practical mind, is feeling&mdash;or
immediate knowledge and immediate sense of Ought.
The basis of thought is an immediate perception&mdash;a
sensuous affection or given something, and the basis
of the idea of a general satisfaction is the natural claim
to determine the outward existence conformably to
individual feeling. In intelligent perception or intuition
the important factor is attention, which raises it above
mere passive acceptance and awareness of a given fact.
Attention thus involves on one hand the externality of
its object, and on the other affirms its dependence on
the act of the subject: it sets the objects before and out
of itself, in space and time, but yet in so doing it shows
itself master of the objects. If perception presuppose
attention, in short, they cease to be wholly outward:
we make them ours, and the space and time they fill are
projected by us. So attended to, they are appropriated,
<pb n='clxxiv'/><anchor id='Pgclxxiv'/>
inwardised and recollected: they take their place in
a mental place and mental time: they receive a general
or de-individualised character in the memory-image.
These are retained as mental property, but retained
actually only in so far they are revivable and revived.
Such revival is the work of imagination working by the
so-called laws of association. But the possession of its
ideas thus inwardised and recollected by the mind is
largely a matter of chance. The mind is not really
fully master of them until it has been able to give them
a certain objectivity, by replacing the mental image by
a vocal, i.e. a sensible sign. By means of words, intelligence
turns its ideas or representations into quasi-realities:
it creates a sort of superior sense-world, the
world of language, where ideas live a potential, which is
also an actual, life. Words are sensibles, but they are
sensibles which completely lose themselves in their
meaning. As sensibles, they render possible that
verbal memory which is the handmaid of thought: but
which also as merely mechanical can leave thought
altogether out of account. It is through words that
thought is made possible: for it alone permits the
movement through ideas without being distracted
through a multitude of associations. In them thought
has an instrument completely at its own level, but still
only a machine, and in memory the working of that
machine. We think in names, not in general images,
but in terms which only serve as vehicles for mental
synthesis and analysis.
</p>

<p>
It is as such a thinking being&mdash;a being who can use
language, and manipulate general concepts or take
comprehensive views, that man is a rational will. A
concept of something to be done&mdash;a feeling even of
some end more or less comprehensive in its quality, is
the implication of what can be called will. At first
<pb n='clxxv'/><anchor id='Pgclxxv'/>
indeed its material may be found as immediately given
and all its volitionality may lie in the circumstance that
the intelligent being sets this forward as a governing
and controlling Ought. Its vehicle, in short, may be
mere impulse, or inclination, and even passion: but it
is the choice and the purposive adoption of means
to the given end. Gradually it attains to the idea of
a general satisfaction, or of happiness. And this end
seems positive and definite. It soon turns out however
to be little but a prudent and self-denying superiority to
particular passions and inclinations in the interest of
a comprehensive ideal. The free will or intelligence
has so far only a negative and formal value: it is the
perfection of an autonomous and freely self-developing
mind. Such a mind, which in language has acquired
the means of realising an intellectual system of things
superior to the restrictions of sense, and which has
emancipated reason from the position of slave to
inclination, is endued with the formal conditions of
moral conduct. Such a mind will transform its own
primarily physical dependence into an image of the law
of reason and create the ethical life: and in the strength
of that establishment will go forth to conquer the world
into a more and more adequate realisation of the
eternal Idea.

<head>Essay V. Ethics And Politics.</head>

<p>
<q>In dealing,</q> says Hegel, <q>with the Idea of the State,
we must not have before our eyes a particular state, or
a particular institution: we must rather study the Idea,
this actual God, on his own account. Every State,
however bad we may find it according to our principles,
however defective we may discover this or that feature
to be, still contains, particularly if it belongs to the
mature states of our time, all the essential factors of its
existence. But as it is easier to discover faults than
to comprehend the affirmative, people easily fall into
the mistake of letting individual aspects obscure the
intrinsic organism of the State itself. The State is no
ideal work of art: it stands in the everyday world, in
the sphere, that is, of arbitrary act, accident, and error,
and a variety of faults may mar the regularity of its
traits. But the ugliest man, the criminal, a sick man
and a cripple, is after all a living man; the affirmative,
Life, subsists in spite of the defect: and this affirmative
is here the theme<note place='foot'>Hegel's <hi rend='italic'>Werke</hi>, viii. 313, and cf. the passage quoted in my <hi rend='italic'>Logic
of Hegel</hi>, notes, pp. 384, 385.</note>.</q> <q>It is the theme of philosophy,</q>
he adds, <q>to ascertain the substance which is immanent
in the show of the temporal and transient, and the
eternal which is present.</q>

<div>
<head>(i.) Hegel as a Political Critic.</head>

<p>
But if this is true, it is also to be remembered that
the philosopher is, like other men, the son of his age,
and estimates the value of reality from preconceptions
and aspirations due to his generation. The historical
circumstances of his nation as well as the personal
experiences of his life help to determine his horizon,
even in the effort to discover the hidden pulse and
movement of the social organism. This is specially
obvious in political philosophy. The conception of
ethics and politics which is presented in the <hi rend='italic'>Encyclopaedia</hi>
was in 1820 produced with more detail as the
<hi rend='italic'>Grundlinien der Philosophie des Rechts</hi>. Appearing, as
it did, two years after his appointment to a professorship
at Berlin, and in the midst of a political struggle
between the various revolutionary and conservative
powers and parties of Germany, the book became, and
long remained, a target for embittered criticism. The
so-called War of Liberation or national movement to
shake off the French yoke was due to a coalition of
parties, and had naturally been in part supported by
tendencies and aims which went far beyond the ostensive
purpose either of leaders or of combatants. Aspirations
after a freer state were entwined with radical and
socialistic designs to reform the political hierarchy
of the Fatherland: high ideals and low vulgarities were
closely intermixed: and the noble enthusiasm of youth
was occasionally played on by criminal and anarchic intriguers.
In a strong and wise and united Germany
some of these schemes might have been tolerated. But
strength, wisdom, and unity were absent. In the existing
tension between Austria and Prussia for the leadership,
in the ill-adapted and effete constitutions of the several
principalities which were yet expected to realise the
<pb n='clxxviii'/><anchor id='Pgclxxviii'/>
advance which had taken place in society and ideas
during the last thirty years, the outlook on every hand
seemed darker and more threatening than it might
have otherwise done. Governments, which had lost
touch with their peoples, suspected conspiracy and
treason: and a party in the nation credited their rulers
with gratuitous designs against private liberty and rights.
There was a vast but ill-defined enthusiasm in the
breasts of the younger world, and it was shared by
many of their teachers. It seemed to their immense
aspirations that the war of liberation had failed of its
true object and left things much as they were. The
volunteers had not fought for the political systems of
Austria or Prussia, or for the three-and-thirty princes
of Germany: but for ideas, vague, beautiful, stimulating.
To such a mood the continuance of the old
system was felt as a cruel deception and a reaction.
The governments on their part had not realised the full
importance of the spirit that had been aroused, and
could not at a moment's notice set their house in order,
even had there been a clearer outlook for reform than
was offered. They too had suffered, and had realised
their insecurity: and were hardly in a mood to open
their gates to the enemy.
</p>

<p>
Coming on such a situation of affairs, Hegel's book
would have been likely in any case to provoke criticism.
For it took up a line of political theory which was little
in accord with the temper of the age. The conception
of the state which it expounded is not far removed in
essentials from the conception which now dominates
the political life of the chief European nations. But in
his own time it came upon ears which were naturally
disposed to misconceive it. It was unacceptable to the
adherents of the <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>ancien régime</foreign>, as much as to the
liberals. It was declared by one party to be a glorification
<pb n='clxxix'/><anchor id='Pgclxxix'/>
of the Prussian state: by another to rationalise
the sanctities of authority. It was pointed out that the
new professor was a favourite of the leading minister,
that his influence was dominant in scholastic appointments,
and that occasional gratuities from the crown
proved his acceptability. A contemporary professor,
Fries, remarked that Hegel's theory of the state had
grown <q>not in the gardens of science but on the dung-hill
of servility.</q> Hegel himself was aware that he
had planted a blow in the face of a <q>shallow and pretentious
sect,</q> and that his book had <q>given great
offence to the demagogic folk.</q> Alike in religious and
political life he was impatient of sentimentalism, of
rhetorical feeling, of wordy enthusiasm. A positive
storm of scorn burst from him at much-promising and
little-containing declamation that appealed to the pathos
of ideas, without sense of the complex work of construction
and the system of principles which were needed
to give them reality. His impatience of demagogic
gush led him (in the preface) into a tactless attack on
Fries, who was at the moment in disgrace for his participation
in the demonstration at the Wartburg. It
led him to an attack on the bumptiousness of those who
held that conscientious conviction was ample justification
for any proceeding:&mdash;an attack which opponents
were not unwilling to represent as directed against the
principle of conscience itself.
</p>

<p>
Yet Hegel's views on the nature of political unity
were not new. Their nucleus had been formed nearly
twenty years before. In the years that immediately
followed the French revolution he had gone through the
usual anarchic stage of intelligent youth. He had wondered
whether humanity might not have had a nobler
destiny, had fate given supremacy to some heresy rather
than the orthodox creed of Christendom. He had
<pb n='clxxx'/><anchor id='Pgclxxx'/>
seen religion in the past <q>teaching what despotism
wished,&mdash;contempt of the human race, its incapacity for
anything good<note place='foot'>Hegel's <hi rend='italic'>Briefe</hi>, i. 15.</note>.</q> But his earliest reflections on political
power belong to a later date, and are inspired, not so
much by the vague ideals of humanitarianism, as by
the spirit of national patriotism. They are found in
a <q>Criticism of the German Constitution</q> apparently
dating from the year 1802<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Kritik der Verfassung Deutschlands</hi>, edited by G. Mollat (1893).
Parts of this were already given by Haym and Rosenkranz. The
same editor has also in this year published, though not quite in full,
Hegel's <hi rend='italic'>System der Sittlichkeit</hi>, to which reference is made in what
follows.</note>. It is written after the
peace of Lunéville had sealed for Germany the loss
of her provinces west of the Rhine, and subsequent
to the disasters of the German arms at Hohenlinden
and Marengo. It is almost contemporaneous with the
measures of 1803 and 1804, which affirmed the dissolution
of the <q>Holy Roman Empire</q> of German name.
The writer of this unpublished pamphlet sees his
country in a situation almost identical with that which
Macchiavelli saw around him in Italy. It is abused by
petty despots, distracted by mean particularist ambitions,
at the mercy of every foreign power. It was such
a scene which, as Hegel recalls, had prompted and
justified the drastic measures proposed in the <hi rend='italic'>Prince</hi>,&mdash;measures
which have been ill-judged by the closet
moralist, but evince the high statesmanship of the
Florentine. In the <hi rend='italic'>Prince</hi>, an intelligent reader can
see <q>the enthusiasm of patriotism underlying the cold
and dispassionate doctrines.</q> Macchiavelli dared to
declare that Italy must become a state, and to assert
that <q>there is no higher duty for a state than to maintain
itself, and to punish relentlessly every author of anarchy,&mdash;the
supreme, and perhaps sole political crime.</q> And
<pb n='clxxxi'/><anchor id='Pgclxxxi'/>
like teaching, Hegel adds, is needed for Germany.
Only, he concludes, no mere demonstration of the insanity
of utter separation of the particular from his kin
will ever succeed in converting the particularists from
their conviction of the absoluteness of personal and
private rights. <q>Insight and intelligence always excite
so much distrust that force alone avails to justify them;
then man yields them obedience<note place='foot'>In which some may find a prophecy of the effects of <q>blood and
iron</q> in 1866.</note>.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The German political edifice,</q> says the writer, <q>is
nothing else but the sum of the rights which the single
parts have withdrawn from the whole; and this justice,
which is ever on the watch to prevent the state having
any power left, is the essence of the constitution.</q> The
Peace of Westphalia had but served to constitute or
stereotype anarchy: the German empire had by that
instrument divested itself of all rights of political unity,
and thrown itself on the goodwill of its members. What
then, it may be asked, is, in Hegel's view, the indispensable
minimum essential to a state? And the answer will
be, organised strength,&mdash;a central and united force.
<q>The strength of a country lies neither in the multitude
of its inhabitants and fighting men, nor in its fertility,
nor in its size, but solely in the way its parts are by
reasonable combination made a single political force
enabling everything to be used for the common defence.</q>
Hegel speaks scornfully of <q>the philanthropists
and moralists who decry politics as an endeavour
and an art to seek private utility at the cost of right</q>:
he tells them that <q>it is foolish to oppose the interest or
(as it is expressed by the more morally-obnoxious word)
the utility of the state to its right</q>: that the <q>rights of
a state are the utility of the state as established and
recognised by compacts</q>: and that <q>war</q> (which they
<pb n='clxxxii'/><anchor id='Pgclxxxii'/>
would fain abolish or moralise) <q>has to decide not
which of the rights asserted by either party is the true
right (&mdash;for both parties have a true right), but which
right has to give way to the other.</q>
</p>

<p>
It is evident from these propositions that Hegel takes
that view of political supremacy which has been associated
with the name of Hobbes. But his views also
reproduce the Platonic king of men, <q>who can rule and
dare not lie.</q> <q>All states,</q> he declares, <q>are founded by
the sublime force of great men, not by physical strength.
The great man has something in his features which
others would gladly call their lord. They obey him
against their will. Their immediate will is his will,
but their conscious will is otherwise.... This is the
prerogative of the great man to ascertain and to express
the absolute will. All gather round his banner. He is
their God.</q> <q>The state,</q> he says again, <q>is the self-certain
absolute mind which recognises no definite
authority but its own: which acknowledges no abstract
rules of good and bad, shameful and mean, craft and
deception.</q> So also Hobbes describes the prerogatives
of the sovereign Leviathan. But the Hegelian God
immanent in the state is a higher power than Hobbes
knows: he is no mortal, but in his truth an immortal
God. He speaks by (what in this early essay is called)
the Absolute Government<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Die Absolute Regierung</hi>: in the <hi rend='italic'>System der Sittlichkeit</hi>, p. 32:
cf. p. 55. Hegel himself compares it to Fichte's <hi rend='italic'>Ephorate</hi>.</note>: the government of the
Law&mdash;the true impersonal sovereign,&mdash;distinct alike
from the single ruler and the multitude of the ruled.
<q>It is absolutely only universality as against particular.
As this absolute, ideal, universal, compared to which
everything else is a particular, it is the phenomenon
of God. Its words are his decision, and it can appear
<pb n='clxxxiii'/><anchor id='Pgclxxxiii'/>
and exist under no other form.... The Absolute
government is divine, self-sanctioned and not made<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Die Absolute Regierung</hi>, l.c. pp. 37, 38.</note>.</q>
The real strength&mdash;the real connecting-mean which
gives life to sovereign and to subject&mdash;is intelligence
free and entire, independent both of what individuals
feel and believe and of the quality of the ruler. <q>The
spiritual bond,</q> he says in a lower form of speech, <q>is
public opinion: it is the true legislative body, national
assembly, declaration of the universal will which lives
in the execution of all commands.</q> This still small
voice of public opinion is the true and real parliament:
not literally making laws, but revealing them. If we
ask, where does this public opinion appear and how
does it disengage itself from the masses of partisan
judgment? Hegel answers,&mdash;and to the surprise of those
who have not entered into the spirit of his age<note place='foot'>Some idea of his meaning may perhaps be gathered by comparison
with passages in <hi rend='italic'>Wilhelm Meister's Wanderjahre</hi>, ii. 1, 2.</note>&mdash;it
is embodied in the Aged and the Priests. Both of these
have ceased to live in the real world: they are by
nature and function disengaged from the struggles of
particular existence, have risen above the divergencies
of social classes. They breathe the ether of pure contemplation.
<q>The sunset of life gives them mystical
lore,</q> or at least removes from old age the distraction
of selfishness: while the priest is by function set apart
from the divisions of human interest. Understood in
a large sense, Hegel's view is that the real voice of
experience is elicited through those who have attained
indifference to the distorting influence of human parties,
and who see life steadily and whole.
</p>

<p>
If this utterance shows the little belief Hegel had in
the ordinary methods of legislation through <q>representative</q>
bodies, and hints that the real <emph>substance</emph> of political
<pb n='clxxxiv'/><anchor id='Pgclxxxiv'/>
life is deeper than the overt machinery of political
operation, it is evident that this theory of <q>divine right</q>
is of a different stamp from what used to go under that
name. And, again, though the power of the central
state is indispensable, he is far from agreeing with the
so-called bureaucratic view that <q>a state is a machine
with a single spring which sets in motion all the rest of
the machinery.</q> <q>Everything,</q> he says, <q>which is not
directly required to organise and maintain the force
for giving security without and within must be left by
the central government to the freedom of the citizens.
Nothing ought to be so sacred in the eyes of a government
as to leave alone and to protect, without regard to
utilities, the free action of the citizens in such matters
as do not affect its fundamental aim: for this freedom
is itself sacred<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Kritik der Verfassung</hi>, p. 20.</note>.</q> He is no friend of paternal bureaucracy.
<q>The pedantic craving to settle every detail,
the mean jealousy against estates and corporations
administrating and directing their own affairs, the base
fault-finding with all independent action on the part of
the citizens, even when it has no immediate bearing
on the main political interest, has been decked out with
reasons to show that no penny of public expenditure,
made for a country of twenty or thirty millions' population,
can be laid out, without first being, not permitted,
but commanded, controlled and revised by the supreme
government.</q> You can see, he remarks, in the first
village after you enter Prussian territory the lifeless and
wooden routine which prevails. The whole country
suffers also from the way religion has been mixed
up with political rights, and a particular creed pronounced
by law indispensable both for sovereign and
full-privileged subject. In a word, the unity and vigour
of the state is quite compatible with considerable latitude
<pb n='clxxxv'/><anchor id='Pgclxxxv'/>
and divergence in laws and judicature, in the
imposition and levying of taxes, in language, manners,
civilisation and religion. Equality in all these points is
desirable for social unity: but it is not indispensable
for political strength.
</p>

<p>
This decided preference for the unity of the state
against the system of checks and counterchecks, which
sometimes goes by the name of a constitution, came out
clearly in Hegel's attitude in discussing the dispute
between the Würtembergers and their sovereign in
1815-16. Würtemberg, with its complicated aggregation
of local laws, had always been a paradise of lawyers,
and the feudal rights or privileges of the local oligarchies&mdash;the
so-called <q>good old law</q>&mdash;were the boast of
the country. All this had however been aggravated by
the increase of territory received in 1805: and the
king, following the examples set by France and even
by Bavaria, promulgated of his own grace a <q>constitution</q>
remodelling the electoral system of the country.
Immediately an outcry burst out against the attempt to
destroy the ancient liberties. Uhland tuned his lyre to
the popular cry: Rückert sang on the king's side. To
Hegel the contest presented itself as a struggle between
the attachment to traditional rights, merely because they
are old, and the resolution to carry out reasonable
reform whether it be agreeable to the reformed or not:
or rather he saw in it resistance of particularism, of
separation, clinging to use and wont, and basing itself
on formal pettifogging objections, against the spirit of
organisation. Anything more he declined to see. And
probably he was right in ascribing a large part of the
opposition to inertia, to vanity and self-interest, combined
with the want of political perception of the needs
of Würtemberg and Germany. But on the other hand,
he failed to remember the insecurity and danger of such
<pb n='clxxxvi'/><anchor id='Pgclxxxvi'/>
<q>gifts of the Danai</q>: he forgot the sense of free-born
men that a constitution is not something to be
granted (<foreign rend='italic'>octroyé</foreign>) as a grace, but something that
must come by the spontaneous act of the innermost
self of the community. He dealt rather with the
formal arguments which were used to refuse progress,
than with the underlying spirit which prompted
the opposition<note place='foot'>In some respects Bacon's attitude in the struggle between royalty
and parliament may be compared.</note>.
</p>

<p>
The philosopher lives (as Plato has well reminded
us) too exclusively within the ideal. Bent on the essential
nucleus of institutions, he attaches but slight importance
to the variety of externals, and fails to realise the
practice of the law-courts. He forgets that what weighs
lightly in logic, may turn the scale in real life and experience.
For feeling and sentiment he has but scant
respect: he is brusque and uncompromising: and
cannot realise all the difficulties and dangers that beset
the Idea in the mazes of the world, and may ultimately
quite alter a plan which at first seemed independent
of petty details. Better than other men perhaps he
recognises in theory how the mere universal only exists
complete in an individual shape: but more than other
men he forgets these truths of insight, when the business
of life calls for action or for judgment. He cannot
at a moment's notice remember that he is, if not, as
Cicero says, <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>in faece Romuli</foreign>, the member of a degenerate
commonwealth, at least living in a world where
good and evil are not, as logic presupposes, sharply
divided but intricately intertwined.
</p>

<pb n='clxxxvii'/><anchor id='Pgclxxxvii'/>

<div>
<head>(ii.) The Ethics and Religion of the State.</head>

<p>
This idealism of political theory is illustrated by the
sketch of the Ethical Life which he drew up about
1802. Under the name of <q>Ethical System</q> it presents
in concentrated or undeveloped shape the doctrine
which subsequently swelled into the <q>Philosophy of
Mind.</q> At a later date he worked out more carefully as
introduction the psychological genesis of moral and
intelligent man, and he separated out more distinctly
as a sequel the universal powers which give to social
life its higher characters. In the earlier sketch the
Ethical Part stands by itself, with the consequence that
Ethics bears a meaning far exceeding all that had been
lately called moral. The word <q>moral</q> itself he avoids<note place='foot'>Just as Schopenhauer, on the contrary, always says <foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>moralisch</foreign>&mdash;never
<foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>sittlich</foreign>.</note>.
It savours of excessive subjectivity, of struggle, of duty
and conscience. It has an ascetic ring about it&mdash;an
aspect of negation, which seeks for abstract holiness,
and turns its back on human nature. Kant's words
opposing duty to inclination, and implying that moral
goodness involves a struggle, an antagonism, a victory,
seem to him (and to his time) one-sided. That aspect
of negation accordingly which Kant certainly began
with, and which Schopenhauer magnified until it became
the all-in-all of Ethics, Hegel entirely subordinates.
Equally little does he like the emphasis on the supremacy
of insight, intention, conscience: they lead, he thinks,
to a view which holds the mere fact of conviction to
be all-important, as if it mattered not what we thought
and believed and did, so long as we were sincere in our
belief. All this emphasis on the good-will, on the
imperative of duty, on the rights of conscience, has,
he admits, its justification in certain circumstances, as
<pb n='clxxxviii'/><anchor id='Pgclxxxviii'/>
against mere legality, or mere natural instinctive goodness;
but it has been overdone. Above all, it errs by
an excess of individualism. It springs from an attitude
of reflection,&mdash;in which the individual, isolated in his
conscious and superficial individuality, yet tries&mdash;but
probably tries in vain&mdash;to get somewhat in touch with
a universal which he has allowed to slip outside him,
forgetting that it is the heart and substance of his life.
Kant, indeed, hardly falls under this condemnation.
For he aims at showing that the rational will inevitably
creates as rational a law or universal; that the individual
act becomes self-regulative, and takes its part in
constituting a system or realm of duty.
</p>

<p>
Still, on the whole, <q>morality</q> in this narrower sense
belongs to an age of reflection, and is formal or nominal
goodness rather than the genuine and full reality. It
is the protest against mere instinctive or customary
virtue, which is but compliance with traditional authority,
and compliance with it as if it were a sort of quasi-natural
law. Moralising reflection is the awakening
of subjectivity and of a deeper personality. The age
which thus precedes morality is not an age in which
kindness, or love, or generosity is unknown. And if
Hegel says that <q>Morality,</q> strictly so called, began
with Socrates, he does not thereby accuse the pre-Socratic
Greeks of inhumanity. But what he does say
is that such ethical life as existed was in the main
a thing of custom and law: of law, moreover, which
was not set objectively forward, but left still in the
stage of uncontradicted usage, a custom which was
a second nature, part of the essential and quasi-physical
ordinance of life. The individual had not yet learned
to set his self-consciousness against these usages and
ask for their justification. These are like the so-called
law of the Medes and Persians which alters not: customs
<pb n='clxxxix'/><anchor id='Pgclxxxix'/>
of immemorial antiquity and unquestionable sway.
They are part of a system of things with which for
good or evil the individual is utterly identified, bound
as it were hand and foot. These are, as a traveller
says<note place='foot'>Grey (G.), <hi rend='italic'>Journals of two Expeditions of Discovery in North-West
and Western Australia</hi>, ii. 220.</note>, <q>oral and unwritten traditions which teach that
certain rules of conduct are to be observed under
certain penalties; and without the aid of fixed records,
or the intervention of a succession of authorised
depositaries and expounders, these laws have been
transmitted to father and son, through unknown generations,
and are fixed in the minds of the people as
sacred and unalterable.</q>
</p>

<p>
The antithesis then in Hegel, as in Kant, is between
Law and Morality, or rather Legality and Morality,&mdash;two
abstractions to which human development is
alternately prone to attach supreme importance. The
first stage in the objectivation of intelligence or in the
evolution of personality is the constitution of mere,
abstract, or strict right. It is the creation of institutions
and uniformities, i.e. of laws, or rights, which
express definite and stereotyped modes of behaviour.
Or, if we look at it from the individual's standpoint, we
may say his consciousness awakes to find the world
parcelled out under certain rules and divisions, which
have objective validity, and govern him with the same
absolute authority as do the circumstances of physical
nature. Under their influence every rank and individual
is alike forced to bow: to each his place and
function is assigned by an order or system which claims
an inviolable and eternal supremacy. It is not the
same place and function for each: but for each the
position and duties are predetermined in this metaphysically-physical
order. The situation and its duties
<pb n='cxc'/><anchor id='Pgcxc'/>
have been created by super-human and natural ordinance.
As the Platonic myth puts it, each order in the
social hierarchy has been framed underground by
powers that turned out men of gold, and silver, and
baser metal: or as the Norse legend tells, they are the
successive offspring of the white God, Heimdal, in his
dealings with womankind.
</p>

<p>
The central idea of the earlier social world is the
supremacy of rights&mdash;but not of right. The sum (for it
cannot be properly called a system) of rights is a self-subsistent
world, to which man is but a servant; and
a second peculiarity of it is its inequality. If all are
equal before the laws, this only means here that the
laws, with their absolute and thorough inequality, are
indifferent to the real and personal diversities of individuals.
Even the so-called equality of primitive law is
of the <q>Eye-for-eye, Tooth-for-tooth</q> kind; it takes no
note of special circumstances; it looks abstractly and
rudely at facts, and maintains a hard and fast uniformity,
which seems the height of unfairness. Rule
stands by rule, usage beside usage,&mdash;a mere aggregate
or multitude of petty tyrants, reduced to no unity or
system, and each pressing with all the weight of an
absolute mandate. The pettiest bit of ceremonial law
is here of equal dignity with the most far-reaching
principle of political obligation.
</p>

<p>
In the essay already referred to, Hegel has designated
something analogous to this as Natural or
Physical Ethics, or as Ethics in its relative or comparative
stage. Here Man first shows his superiority
to nature, or enters on his properly ethical function,
by transforming the physical world into his possession.
He makes himself the lord of natural objects&mdash;stamping
them as his, and not their own, making them his permanent
property, his tools, his instruments of exchange
<pb n='cxci'/><anchor id='Pgcxci'/>
and production. The fundamental ethical act is appropriation
by labour, and the first ethical world is the
creation of an economic system, the institution of property.
For property, or at least possession and appropriation,
is the dominant idea, with its collateral and
sequent principles. And at first, even human beings
are treated on the same method as other things: as
objects in a world of objects or aggregate of things:
as things to be used and acquired, as means and instruments,&mdash;not
in any sense as ends in themselves. It is
a world in which the relation of master and slave is
dominant,&mdash;where owner and employer is set in antithesis
against his tools and chattels. But the Nemesis
of his act issues in making the individual the servant of
his so-called property. He has become an objective
power by submitting himself to objectivity: he has
literally put himself into the object he has wrought, and
is now a thing among things: for what he owns, what
he has appropriated, determines what he is. The real
powers in the world thus established are the laws of
possession-holding: the laws dominate man: and he is
only freed from dependence on casual externals, by
making himself thoroughly the servant of his possessions.
</p>

<p>
The only salvation, and it is but imperfect, that can
be reached on this stage is by the family union. The
sexual tie, is at first entirely on a level with the other
arrangements of the sphere. The man or woman is but
a chattel and a tool; a casual appropriation which gradually
is transformed into a permanent possession and
a permanent bond<note place='foot'>With some variation of ownership, perhaps, according to the
prevalence of so-called matriarchal or patriarchal households.</note>. But, as the family constituted
itself, it helped to afford a promise of better things.
An ideal interest&mdash;the religion of the household&mdash;extending
<pb n='cxcii'/><anchor id='Pgcxcii'/>
beyond the individual, and beyond the
moment,&mdash;binding past and present, and parents to
offspring, gave a new character to the relation of property.
Parents and children form a unity, which overrides
and essentially permeates their <q>difference</q> from
each other: there is no exchange, no contract, nor, in
the stricter sense, property between the members. In
the property-idea they are lifted out of their isolation,
and in the continuity of family life there is a certain
analogue of immortality. But, says Hegel, <q>though the
family be the highest totality of which Nature is capable,
the absolute identity is in it still inward, and is not
instituted in absolute form; and hence, too, the reproduction
of the totality is an appearance, the appearance
of the children<note place='foot'>Cf. the custom in certain tribes which names the father after his
child: as if the son first gave his father legitimate position in society.</note>.</q> <q>The power and the intelligence, the
<q>difference</q> of the parents, stands in inverse proportion
to the youth and vigour of the child: and these
two sides of life flee from and are sequent on each
other, and are reciprocally external<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>System der Sittlichkeit</hi>, p. 8.</note>.</q> Or, as we may
put it, the god of the family is a departed ancestor,
a ghost in the land of the dead: it has not really
a continuous and unified life. In such a state of
society&mdash;a state of nature&mdash;and in its supreme form, the
family, there is no adequate principle which though real
shall still give ideality and unity to the self-isolating
aspects of life. There is wanted something which shall
give expression to its <q>indifference,</q> which shall control
the tendency of this partial moralisation to sink at
every moment into individuality, and lift it from its immersion
in nature. Family life and economic groups
(&mdash;for these two, which Hegel subsequently separates,
are here kept close together) need an ampler and wider
<pb n='cxciii'/><anchor id='Pgcxciii'/>
life to keep them from stagnating in their several
selfishnesses.
</p>

<p>
This freshening and corrective influence they get in
the first instance from deeds of violence and crime.
Here is the <q>negative unsettling</q> of the narrow fixities,
of the determinate conditions or relationships into which
the preceding processes of labour and acquisition have
tended to stereotype life. The harsh restriction brings
about its own undoing. Man may subject natural
objects to his formative power, but the wild rage of
senseless devastation again and again bursts forth to
restore the original formlessness. He may build up
his own pile of wealth, store up his private goods, but
the thief and the robber with the instincts of barbarian
socialism tread on his steps: and every stage of appropriation
has for its sequel a crop of acts of dispossession.
He may secure by accumulation his future life; but the
murderer for gain's sake cuts it short. And out of all
this as a necessary consequence stands avenging justice.
And in the natural world of ethics&mdash;where true moral
life has not yet arisen&mdash;this is mere retaliation or the
<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>lex talionis</foreign>;&mdash;the beginning of an endless series of vengeance
and counter-vengeance, the blood-feud. Punishment,
in the stricter sense of the term,&mdash;which looks
both to antecedents and effects in character&mdash;cannot yet
come into existence; for to punish there must be something
superior to individualities, an ethical idea embodied
in an institution, to which the injurer and the injured
alike belong. But as yet punishment is only vengeance,
the personal and natural equivalent, the physical
reaction against injury, perhaps regulated and formulated
by custom and usage, but not essentially altered
from its purely retaliatory character. These crimes&mdash;or
transgressions&mdash;are thus by Hegel quaintly conceived
as storms which clear the air&mdash;which shake the individualist
<pb n='cxciv'/><anchor id='Pgcxciv'/>
out of his slumber. The scene in which transgression
thus acts is that of the so-called state of nature,
where particularism was rampant: where moral right
was not, but only the right of nature, of pre-occupation,
of the stronger, of the first maker and discoverer. Crime
is thus the <q>dialectic</q> which shakes the fixity of practical
arrangements, and calls for something in which the idea
of a higher unity, a permanent substance of life, shall
find realisation.
</p>

<p>
The <q>positive supersession<note place='foot'><foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Aufhebung</foreign> (<emph>positive</emph>) as given in <foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>absolute Sittlichkeit</foreign>.</note></q> of individualism and
naturalism in ethics is by Hegel called <q>Absolute
Ethics.</q> Under this title he describes the ethics and
religion of the state&mdash;a religion which is immanent in
the community, and an ethics which rises superior
to particularity. The picture he draws is a romance
fashioned upon the model of the Greek commonwealth
as that had been idealised by Greek literature and by
the longings of later ages for a freer life. It is but one
of the many modes in which Helena&mdash;to quote Goethe&mdash;has
fascinated the German Faust. He dreams himself
away from the prosaic worldliness of a German municipality
to the unfading splendour of the Greek city
with its imagined coincidence of individual will with
universal purpose. There is in such a commonwealth
no pain of surrender and of sacrifice, and no subsequent
compensation: for, at the very moment of resigning self-will
to common aims, he enjoys it retained with the
added zest of self-expansion. He is not so left to himself
as to feel from beyond the restraint of a law which
controls&mdash;even if it wisely and well controls&mdash;individual
effort. There is for his happy circumstances no possibility
of doing otherwise. Or, it may be, Hegel has
reminiscences from the ideals of other nations than the
Greek. He recalls the Israelite depicted by the Law-adoring
<pb n='cxcv'/><anchor id='Pgcxcv'/>
psalmist, whose delight is to do the will of the
Lord, whom the zeal of God's house has consumed,
whose whole being runs on in one pellucid stream with
the universal and eternal stream of divine commandment.
Such a frame of spirit, where the empirical
consciousness with all its soul and strength and mind
identifies its mission into conformity with the absolute
order, is the mood of absolute Ethics. It is what some
have spoken of as the True life, as the Eternal life; in
it, says Hegel, the individual exists <foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>auf ewige Weise</foreign><note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>System der Sittlichkeit</hi>, p. 15.</note>, as
it were <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>sub specie aeternitatis</foreign>: his life is hid with his
fellows in the common life of his people. His every
act, and thought, and will, get their being and significance
from a reality which is established in him as
a permanent spirit. It is there that he, in the fuller
sense, attains αὐτάρκεια, or finds himself no longer a mere
part, but an ideal totality. This totality is realised under
the particular form of a Nation (<foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Volk</foreign>), which in the visible
sphere represents (or rather is, as a particular) the
absolute and infinite. Such a unity is neither the mere
sum of isolated individuals, nor a mere majority ruling
by numbers: but the fraternal and organic commonwealth
which brings all classes and all rights from their
particularistic independence into an ideal identity and
indifference<note place='foot'>This phraseology shows the influence of Schelling, with whom
he was at this epoch associated. See <hi rend='italic'>Prolegomena to the Study of
Hegel</hi>, ch. xiv.</note>. Here all are not merely equal before the
laws: but the law itself is a living and organic unity,
self-correcting, subordinating and organising, and no
longer merely defining individual privileges and so-called
liberties. <q>In such conjunction of the universal
with the particularity lies the divinity of a nation: or, if
we give this universal a separate place in our ideas,
<pb n='cxcvi'/><anchor id='Pgcxcvi'/>
it is the God of the nation.</q> But in this complete
accordance between concept and intuition, between
visible and invisible, where symbol and significate are
one, religion and ethics are indistinguishable. It is the
old conception (and in its highest sense) of Theocracy<note place='foot'>Cf. the intermediate function assigned (see above, p. <ref target='Pgclxxxiii'>clxxxiii</ref>) to
the priests and the aged.</note>.
God is the national head and the national life: and in
him all individuals have their <q>difference</q> rendered
<q>indifferent.</q> <q>Such an ethical life is absolute truth,
for untruth is only in the fixture of a single mode: but
in the everlasting being of the nation all singleness is
superseded. It is absolute culture; for in the eternal
is the real and empirical annihilation and prescription of
all limited modality. It is absolute disinterestedness:
for in the eternal there is nothing private and personal.
It, and each of its movements, is the highest beauty:
for beauty is but the eternal made actual and given
concrete shape. It is without pain, and blessed: for in
it all difference and all pain is superseded. It is the
divine, absolute, real, existing and being, under no veil;
nor need one first raise it up into the ideality of divinity,
and extract it from the appearance and empirical intuition;
but it is, and immediately, absolute intuition<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>System der Sittlichkeit</hi>, p. 19.</note>.</q>
</p>

<p>
If we compare this language with the statement of the
Encyclopaedia we can see how for the moment Hegel's
eye is engrossed with the glory of the ideal nation. In
it, the moral life embraces and is co-extensive with religion,
art and science: practice and theory are at one:
life in the idea knows none of those differences which,
in the un-ideal world, make art and morality often antithetical,
and set religion at variance with science. It
is, as we have said, a memory of Greek and perhaps
Hebrew ideals. Or rather it is by the help of such
<pb n='cxcvii'/><anchor id='Pgcxcvii'/>
memories the affirmation of the essential unity of life&mdash;the
true, complete, many-sided life&mdash;which is the presupposition
and idea that culture and morals rest upon
and from which they get their supreme sanction, i.e. their
constitutive principle and unity. Even in the Encyclopaedia<note place='foot'>See <hi rend='italic'>infra</hi>, p. <ref target='Pg156'>156</ref>.</note>
Hegel endeavours to guard against the severance
of morality and art and philosophy which may be rashly
inferred in consequence of his serial order of treatment.
<q>Religion,</q> he remarks, <q>is the very substance of the
moral life itself and of the state.... The ethical life is
the divine spirit indwelling in consciousness, as it is
actually present in a nation and its individual members.</q>
Yet, as we see, there is a distinction. The process of
history carries out a judgment on nation after nation,
and reveals the divine as not only immanent in the
ethical life but as ever expanding the limited national
spirit till it become a spirit of universal humanity.
Still&mdash;and this is perhaps for each time always the
more important&mdash;the national unity&mdash;not indeed as
a multitude, nor as a majority&mdash;is the supreme real
appearance of the Eternal and Absolute.
</p>

<p>
Having thus described the nation as an organic
totality, he goes on to point out that the political constitution
shows this character by forming a triplicity of
political orders. In one of these there is but a silent,
practical identity, in faith and trust, with the totality: in
the second there is a thorough disruption of interest
into particularity: and in the third, there is a living and
intellectual identity or indifference, which combines the
widest range of individual development with the completest
unity of political loyalty. This last order is that
which lives in conscious identification of private with
public duty: all that it does has a universal and public
function. Such a body is the ideal Nobility&mdash;the
<pb n='cxcviii'/><anchor id='Pgcxcviii'/>
nobility which is the <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>servus servorum Dei</foreign>, the supreme
servant of humanity. Its function is to maintain general
interests, to give the other orders (peasantry and industrials)
security,&mdash;receiving in return from these others
the means of subsistence. <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>Noblesse oblige</foreign> gives the
death-blow to particular interests, and imposes the duty
of exhibiting, in the clearest form, the supreme reality
of absolute morality, and of being to the rest an
unperturbed ideal of aesthetic, ethical, religious, and
philosophical completeness.
</p>

<p>
It is here alone, in this estate which is absolutely
disinterested, that the virtues appear in their true
light. To the ordinary moralising standpoint they seem
severally to be, in their separation, charged with independent
value. But from the higher point of view the
existence, and still more the accentuation of single
virtues, is a mark of incompleteness. Even quality, it
has been said, involves its defects: it can only shine by
eclipsing or reflecting something else. The completely
moral is not the sum of the several virtues, but the
reduction of them to indifference. It is thus that when
Plato tries to get at the unity of virtue, their aspect of
difference tends to be subordinated. <q>The movement of
absolute morality runs through all the virtues, but settles
fixedly in none.</q> It is more than love <emph>to</emph> fatherland, and
nation, and laws:&mdash;that still implies a relation to something
and involves a difference. For love&mdash;the mortal
passion, where <q>self is not annulled</q>&mdash;is the process of
approximation, while unity is not yet attained, but wished
and aimed at: and when it is complete&mdash;and become
<q>such love as spirits know<note place='foot'>Wordsworth's <hi rend='italic'>Laodamia</hi>.</note></q>&mdash;it gives place to a calmer
rest and an active immanence. The absolute morality
is <emph>life in</emph> the fatherland and for the nation. In the individual
however it is the process upward and inward
<pb n='cxcix'/><anchor id='Pgcxcix'/>
that we see, not the consummation. Then the identity
appears as an ideal, as a tendency not yet accomplished
to its end, a possibility not yet made fully actual. At
bottom&mdash;in the divine substance in which the individual
inheres&mdash;the identity is present: but in the appearance,
we have only the passage from possible to
actual, a passage which has the aspect of a struggle.
Hence the moral act appears as a virtue, with merit or
desert. It is accordingly the very characteristic of
virtue to signalise its own incompleteness: it emerges
into actuality only through antagonism, and with a taint
of imperfection clinging to it. Thus, in the field of
absolute morality, if the virtues appear, it is only in their
transiency. If they were undisputedly real in morality,
they would not separately show. To feel that you have
done well implies that you have not done wholly well:
self-gratulation in meritorious deed is the re-action
from the shudder at feeling that the self was not wholly
good.
</p>

<p>
The essential unity of virtue&mdash;its negative character
as regards all the empirical variety of virtues&mdash;is seen
in the excellences required by the needs of war. These
military requirements demonstrate the mere relativity
and therefore non-virtuousness of the special virtues.
They equally protest against the common beliefs in the
supreme dignity of labour and its utilities. But if bravery
or soldierlike virtue be essentially a virtue of virtues,
it is only a negative virtue after all. It is the blast of
the universal sweeping away all the habitations and
fixed structures of particularist life. If it is a unity of
virtue, it is only a negative unity&mdash;an indifference. If
it avoid the parcelling of virtue into a number of
imperfect and sometimes contradictory parts, it does so
only to present a bare negation. The soldier, therefore,
if in potentiality the unity of all the virtues, may
<pb n='cc'/><anchor id='Pgcc'/>
tend in practice to represent the ability to do without
any of them<note place='foot'><p><q>For it's Tommy this, an' Tommy that, an' <q>Chuck him out, the brute!</q><lb/>
But it's <q>Saviour of 'is country</q> when the guns begin to shoot.</q></p></note>.
</p>

<p>
The home of these <q>relative</q> virtues&mdash;of morality in
the ordinary sense&mdash;is the life of the second order in
the commonwealth: the order of industry and commerce.
In this sphere the idea of the universal is
gradually lost to view: it becomes, says Hegel, only
a thought or a creature of the mind, which does not
affect practice. The materialistic worker of civilisation
does not see further than the empirical existence of
individuals: his horizon is limited by the family, and
his final ideal is a competency of comfort in possessions
and revenues. The supreme universal to which he
attains as the climax of his evolution is only money.
But it is only with the vaster development of commerce
that this terrible consequence ensues. At first as
a mere individual, he has higher aims, though not the
highest. He has a limited ideal determined by his
special sphere of work. To win respect&mdash;the character
for a limited truthfulness and honesty and skilful work&mdash;is
his ambition. He lives in a conceit of his performance&mdash;his
utility&mdash;the esteem of his special circle. To
his commercial soul the military order is a scarecrow
and a nuisance: military honour is but trash. Yet if
his range of idea is narrow and engrossing in details,
his aim is to get worship, to be recognised as the best
in his little sphere. But with the growth of the trading
spirit his character changes: he becomes the mere
capitalist, is denationalised, has no definite work and
can claim no individualised function. Money now
measures all things: it is the sole ultimate reality. It
<pb n='cci'/><anchor id='Pgcci'/>
transforms everything into a relation of contract: even
vengeance is equated in terms of money. Its motto is,
The Exchanges must be honoured, though honour and
morality may go to the dogs. So far as it is concerned,
there is no nation, but a federation of shopkeepers.
Such an one is the <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>bourgeois</foreign> (the <foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Bürger</foreign>, as distinct
from the peasant or <foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Bauer</foreign> and the <foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Adel</foreign>). As an
artisan&mdash;i.e. a mere industrial, he knows no country,
but at best the reputation and interest of his own guild-union
with its partial object. He is narrow, but honest
and respectable. As a mere commercial agent, he knows
no country: his field is the world, but the world not in
its concreteness and variety, but in the abstract aspect
of a money-bag and an exchange. The larger totality
is indeed not altogether out of sight. But if he contribute
to the needy, either his sacrifice is lifeless in
proportion as it becomes general, or loses generality as
it becomes lively. As regards his general services to
the great life of his national state<note place='foot'><q>I can assure you,</q> said Werner (the merchant), <q>that I never
reflected on the State in my life. My tolls, charges and dues I have
paid for no other reason than that it was established usage.</q> (<hi rend='italic'>Wilh.
Meisters Lehrjahre</hi>, viii. 2.)</note>, they are unintelligently
and perhaps grudgingly rendered.
</p>

<p>
Of the peasant order Hegel has less to say. On one
side the <q>country</q> as opposed to the <q>town</q> has a closer
natural sympathy with the common and general interest:
and the peasantry is the undifferentiated, solid and
sound, basis of the national life. It forms the submerged
mass, out of which the best soldiers are made,
and which out of the depths of earth brings forward
nourishment as well as all the materials of elementary
necessity. Faithfulness and loyalty are its virtues:
but it is personal allegiance to a commanding superior,&mdash;not
to a law or a general view&mdash;for the peasant is
<pb n='ccii'/><anchor id='Pgccii'/>
weak in comprehensive intelligence, though shrewd in
detailed observation.
</p>

<p>
Of the purely political function of the state Hegel in
this sketch says almost nothing. But under the head of
the general government of the state he deals with its
social functions. For a moment he refers to the well-known
distinction of the legislative, judicial and executive
powers. But it is only to remark that <q>in every
governmental act all three are conjoined. They are
abstractions, none of which can get a reality of its
own,&mdash;which, in other words, cannot be constituted
and organised as powers. Legislation, judicature, and
executive are something completely formal, empty, and
contentless.... Whether the others are or are not bare
abstractions, empty activities, depends entirely on the
executive power; and this is absolutely the government<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>System der Sittlichkeit</hi>, p. 40.</note>.</q>
Treating government as the organic movement
by which the universal and the particular in the commonwealth
come into relations, he finds that it presents
three forms, or gives rise to three systems. The highest
and last of these is the <q>educational</q> system. By this
he understands all that activity by which the intelligence
of the state tries directly to mould and guide the character
and fortunes of its members: all the means of
culture and discipline, whether in general or for individuals,
all training to public function, to truthfulness,
to good manners. Under the same head come conquest
and colonisation as state agencies. The second system
is the judicial, which instead of, like the former, aiming
at the formation or reformation of its members is satisfied
by subjecting individual transgression to a process
of rectification by the general principle. With regard
to the system of judicature, Hegel argues for a variety
of procedure to suit different ranks, and for a corresponding
<pb n='cciii'/><anchor id='Pgcciii'/>
modification of penalties. <q>Formal rigid
equality is just what does not spare the character. The
same penalty which in one estate brings no infamy causes
in another a deep and irremediable hurt.</q> And with
regard to the after life of the transgressor who has
borne his penalty: <q>Punishment is the reconciliation
of the law with itself. No further reproach for his
crime can be addressed to the person who has undergone
his punishment. He is restored to membership
of his estate<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>System der Sittlichkeit</hi>, p. 65.</note>.</q>
</p>

<p>
In the first of the three systems, the economic system,
or <q>System of wants,</q> the state seems at first hardly to
appear in its universal and controlling function at all.
Here the individual depends for the satisfaction of his
physical needs on a blind, unconscious destiny, on the
obscure and incalculable properties of supply and
demand in the whole interconnexion of commodities.
But even this is not all. With the accumulation of
wealth in inequality, and the growth of vast capitals,
there is substituted for the dependence of the individual
on the general resultant of a vast number of agencies
a dependence on one enormously rich individual, who
can control the physical destinies of a nation. But
a nation, truly speaking, is there no more. The industrial
order has parted into a mere abstract workman on
one hand, and the <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>grande richesse</foreign> on the other. <q>It
has lost its capacity of an organic absolute intuition and
of respect for the divine&mdash;external though its divinity be:
and there sets in the bestiality of contempt for all that is
noble. The mere wisdomless universal, the mass of
wealth, is the essential: and the ethical principle, the
absolute bond of the nation, is vanished; and the nation
is dissolved<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Ibid.</hi> p. 46.</note>.</q>
</p>

<p>
It would be a long and complicated task to sift, in
<pb n='cciv'/><anchor id='Pgcciv'/>
these ill-digested but profound suggestions, the real
meaning from the formal statement. They are, like
Utopia, beyond the range of practical politics. The
modern reader, whose political conceptions are limited
by contemporary circumstance, may find them archaic,
medieval, quixotic. But for those who behind the
words and forms can see the substance and the
idea, they will perhaps come nearer the conception of
ideal commonwealth than many reforming programmes.
Compared with the maturer statements of the <hi rend='italic'>Philosophy
of Law</hi>, they have the faults of the Romantic age to
which their inception belongs. Yet even in that later
exposition there is upheld the doctrine of the supremacy
of the eternal State against everything particular, class-like,
and temporary; a doctrine which has made
Hegel&mdash;as it made Fichte&mdash;a voice in that <q>professorial
socialism</q> which is at least as old as Plato.

<p>
§ 377. The knowledge of Mind is the highest and
hardest, just because it is the most <q>concrete</q> of
sciences. The significance of that <q>absolute</q> commandment,
<emph>Know thyself</emph>&mdash;whether we look at it in itself
or under the historical circumstances of its first utterance&mdash;is
not to promote mere self-knowledge in respect
of the <emph>particular</emph> capacities, character, propensities, and
foibles of the single self. The knowledge it commands
means that of man's genuine reality&mdash;of what is essentially
and ultimately true and real&mdash;of mind as the true
and essential being. Equally little is it the purport of
mental philosophy to teach what is called <emph>knowledge of
men</emph>&mdash;the knowledge whose aim is to detect the <emph>peculiarities</emph>,
passions, and foibles of other men, and lay
bare what are called the recesses of the human heart.
Information of this kind is, for one thing, meaningless,
unless on the assumption that we know the <emph>universal</emph>&mdash;man
as man, and, that always must be, as mind. And
for another, being only engaged with casual, insignificant
and <emph>untrue</emph> aspects of mental life, it fails to reach
the underlying essence of them all&mdash;the mind itself.
</p>

<pb n='004'/><anchor id='Pg004'/>

<p>
§ 378. Pneumatology, or, as it was also called,
Rational Psychology, has been already alluded to in
the Introduction to the Logic as an <emph>abstract</emph> and
generalising metaphysic of the subject. <emph>Empirical</emph> (or
inductive) psychology, on the other hand, deals with
the <q>concrete</q> mind: and, after the revival of the
sciences, when observation and experience had been
made the distinctive methods for the study of concrete
reality, such psychology was worked on the same
lines as other sciences. In this way it came about
that the metaphysical theory was kept outside the
inductive science, and so prevented from getting any
concrete embodiment or detail: whilst at the same time
the inductive science clung to the conventional common-sense
metaphysic, with its analysis into forces, various
activities, &amp;c., and rejected any attempt at a <q>speculative</q>
treatment.
</p>

<p>
The books of Aristotle on the Soul, along with his
discussions on its special aspects and states, are for
this reason still by far the most admirable, perhaps
even the sole, work of philosophical value on this
topic. The main aim of a philosophy of mind can
only be to re-introduce unity of idea and principle into
the theory of mind, and so re-interpret the lesson of
those Aristotelian books.
</p>

<p>
§ 379. Even our own sense of the mind's <emph>living</emph> unity
naturally protests against any attempt to break it up
into different faculties, forces, or, what comes to the
same thing, activities, conceived as independent of each
other. But the craving for a <emph>comprehension</emph> of the
unity is still further stimulated, as we soon come across
distinctions between mental freedom and mental determinism,
antitheses between free <emph>psychic</emph> agency and the
corporeity that lies external to it, whilst we equally
note the intimate interdependence of the one upon the
<pb n='005'/><anchor id='Pg005'/>
other. In modern times especially the phenomena of
<emph>animal magnetism</emph> have given, even in experience,
a lively and visible confirmation of the underlying unity
of soul, and of the power of its <q>ideality.</q> Before
these facts, the rigid distinctions of practical common
sense were struck with confusion; and the necessity
of a <q>speculative</q> examination with a view to the
removal of difficulties was more directly forced upon
the student.
</p>

<p>
§ 380. The <q>concrete</q> nature of mind involves for the
observer the peculiar difficulty that the several grades
and special types which develop its intelligible unity in
detail are not left standing as so many separate
existences confronting its more advanced aspects. It is
otherwise in external nature. There, matter and movement,
for example, have a manifestation all their own&mdash;it
is the solar system; and similarly the <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>differentiae</foreign> of
sense-perception have a sort of earlier existence in the
properties of <emph>bodies</emph>, and still more independently in
the four elements. The species and grades of mental
evolution, on the contrary, lose their separate existence
and become factors, states and features in the higher
grades of development. As a consequence of this,
a lower and more abstract aspect of mind betrays the
presence in it, even to experience, of a higher grade.
Under the guise of sensation, e.g., we may find the very
highest mental life as its modification or its embodiment.
And so sensation, which is but a mere form and
vehicle, may to the superficial glance seem to be the
proper seat and, as it were, the source of those moral
and religious principles with which it is charged; and
the moral and religious principles thus modified may
seem to call for treatment as species of sensation. But
at the same time, when lower grades of mental life are
under examination, it becomes necessary, if we desire
<pb n='006'/><anchor id='Pg006'/>
to point to actual cases of them in experience, to direct
attention to more advanced grades for which they are
mere forms. In this way subjects will be treated of by
anticipation which properly belong to later stages of
development (e.g. in dealing with natural awaking from
sleep we speak by anticipation of consciousness, or in
dealing with mental derangement we must speak of
intellect).

<div>
<head>What Mind (or Spirit) is.</head>

<p>
§ 381. From our point of view Mind has for its <emph>presupposition</emph>
Nature, of which it is the truth, and for that
reason its <foreign rend='italic'>absolute prius</foreign>. In this its truth Nature is
vanished, and mind has resulted as the <q>Idea</q> entered
on possession of itself. Here the subject and object of
the Idea are one&mdash;either is the intelligent unity, the
notion. This identity is <emph>absolute negativity</emph>&mdash;for whereas
in Nature the intelligent unity has its objectivity perfect
but externalised, this self-externalisation has been
nullified and the unity in that way been made one
and the same with itself. Thus at the same time it
is this identity only so far as it is a return out of
nature.
</p>

<p>
§ 382. For this reason the essential, but formally
essential, feature of mind is Liberty: i.e. it is the
notion's absolute negativity or self-identity. Considered
as this formal aspect, it <emph>may</emph> withdraw itself from everything
external and from its own externality, its very
existence; it can thus submit to infinite <emph>pain</emph>, the
negation of its individual immediacy: in other words,
it can keep itself affirmative in this negativity and
possess its own identity. All this is possible so long
as it is considered in its abstract self-contained
universality.
</p>

<p>
§ 383. This universality is also its determinate sphere
<pb n='007'/><anchor id='Pg007'/>
of being. Having a being of its own, the universal
is self-particularising, whilst it still remains self-identical.
Hence the special mode of mental being is
<q><emph>manifestation</emph>.</q> The spirit is not some one mode or
meaning which finds utterance or externality only in
a form distinct from itself: it does not manifest or
reveal <emph>something</emph>, but its very mode and meaning is this
revelation. And thus in its mere possibility Mind is at
the same moment an infinite, <q>absolute,</q> <emph>actuality</emph>.
</p>

<p>
§ 384. <emph>Revelation</emph>, taken to mean the revelation of the
<emph>abstract</emph> Idea, is an unmediated transition to Nature
which <emph>comes</emph> to be. As Mind is free, its manifestation
is to <emph>set forth</emph> Nature as <emph>its</emph> world; but because it is
reflection, it, in thus setting forth its world, at the
same time <emph>presupposes</emph> the world as a nature independently
existing. In the intellectual sphere to reveal
is thus to create a world as its being&mdash;a being in
which the mind procures the <emph>affirmation</emph> and <emph>truth</emph> of
its freedom.
</p>

<p>
<emph>The Absolute is Mind</emph> (Spirit)&mdash;this is the supreme
definition of the Absolute. To find this definition and
to grasp its meaning and burthen was, we may say, the
ultimate purpose of all education and all philosophy:
it was the point to which turned the impulse of all
religion and science: and it is this impulse that must
explain the history of the world. The word <q>Mind</q>
(Spirit)&mdash;and some glimpse of its meaning&mdash;was found at
an early period: and the spirituality of God is the lesson
of Christianity. It remains for philosophy in its own
element of intelligible unity to get hold of what was
thus given as a mental image, and what implicitly is the
ultimate reality: and that problem is not genuinely, and
by rational methods, solved so long as liberty and
intelligible unity is not the theme and the soul of
philosophy.
</p>

</div>

<pb n='008'/><anchor id='Pg008'/>

<div>
<head>Subdivision.</head>

<p>
§ 385. The development of Mind (Spirit) is in three
stages:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
(1) In the form of self-relation: within it it has the <emph>ideal</emph>
totality of the Idea&mdash;i.e. it has before it all that its
notion contains: its being is to be self-contained and
free. This is <emph>Mind Subjective</emph>.
</p>

<p>
(2) In the form of <emph>reality</emph>: realised, i.e. in a <emph>world</emph>
produced and to be produced by it: in this world
freedom presents itself under the shape of necessity.
This is <emph>Mind Objective</emph>.
</p>

<p>
(3) In that unity of mind as objectivity and, of mind
as ideality and concept, which essentially and actually
is and for ever produces itself, mind in its absolute
truth. This is <emph>Mind Absolute</emph>.
</p>

<p>
§ 386. The two first parts of the doctrine of Mind
embrace the finite mind. Mind is the infinite Idea;
thus finitude here means the disproportion between the
concept and the reality&mdash;but with the qualification that
it is a shadow cast by the mind's own light&mdash;a show or
illusion which the mind implicitly imposes as a barrier
to itself, in order, by its removal, actually to realise and
become conscious of freedom as <emph>its</emph> very being, i.e. to
be fully <emph>manifested</emph>. The several steps of this activity,
on each of which, with their semblance of being, it is
the function of the finite mind to linger, and through
which it has to pass, are steps in its liberation. In the
full truth of that liberation is given the identification of
the three stages&mdash;finding a world presupposed before
us, generating a world as our own creation, and gaining
freedom from it and in it. To the infinite form of this
truth the show purifies itself till it becomes a consciousness
of it.
</p>

<p>
A rigid application of the category of finitude by
<pb n='009'/><anchor id='Pg009'/>
the abstract logician is chiefly seen in dealing with
Mind and reason: it is held not a mere matter of strict
logic, but treated also as a moral and religious concern,
to adhere to the point of view of finitude, and the wish
to go further is reckoned a mark of audacity, if not of
insanity, of thought. Whereas in fact such a <emph>modesty</emph>
of thought, as treats the finite as something altogether
fixed and <emph>absolute</emph>, is the worst of virtues; and to stick
to a post which has no sound ground in itself is the most
unsound sort of theory. The category of finitude was
at a much earlier period elucidated and explained at its
place in the Logic: an elucidation which, as in logic
for the more specific though still simple thought-forms
of finitude, so in the rest of philosophy for the concrete
forms, has merely to show that the finite <emph>is not</emph>, i.e. is
not the truth, but merely a transition and an emergence
to something higher. This finitude of the spheres so
far examined is the dialectic that makes a thing have
its cessation by another and in another: but Spirit, the
intelligent unity and the <emph>implicit</emph> Eternal, is itself just
the consummation of that internal act by which nullity
is nullified and vanity is made vain. And so, the
modesty alluded to is a retention of this vanity&mdash;the
finite&mdash;in opposition to the true: it is itself therefore
vanity. In the course of the mind's development we
shall see this vanity appear as <emph>wickedness</emph> at that turning-point
at which mind has reached its extreme immersion
in its subjectivity and its most central contradiction.

<head>Section I. Mind Subjective.</head>

<p>
§ 387. Mind, on the ideal stage of its development, is
mind as <emph>cognitive</emph>: Cognition, however, being taken here
not as a merely logical category of the Idea (§ 223), but
in the sense appropriate to the <emph>concrete</emph> mind.
</p>

<p>
Subjective mind is:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
(A) Immediate or implicit: a soul&mdash;the Spirit in
<emph>Nature</emph>&mdash;the object treated by <emph>Anthropology</emph>.
</p>

<p>
(B) Mediate or explicit: still as identical reflection
into itself and into other things: mind in correlation
or particularisation: consciousness&mdash;the object treated
by the <emph>Phenomenology of Mind</emph>.
</p>

<p>
(C) Mind defining itself in itself, as an independent
subject&mdash;the object treated by <emph>Psychology</emph>.
</p>

<p>
In the Soul is the <emph>awaking of Consciousness</emph>: Consciousness
sets itself up as Reason, awaking at one
bound to the sense of its rationality: and this Reason
by its activity emancipates itself to objectivity and the
consciousness of its intelligent unity.
</p>

<p>
For an intelligible unity or principle of comprehension
each modification it presents is an advance of <emph>development</emph>:
and so in mind every character under which it
appears is a stage in a process of specification and
development, a step forward towards its goal, in order
<pb n='011'/><anchor id='Pg011'/>
to make itself into, and to realise in itself, what it
implicitly is. Each step, again, is itself such a process,
and its product is that what the mind was implicitly at
the beginning (and so for the observer) it is <emph>for itself</emph>&mdash;for
the special form, viz. which the mind has in that step.
The ordinary method of psychology is to narrate what
the mind or soul is, what happens to it, what it does.
The soul is presupposed as a ready-made agent, which
displays such features as its acts and utterances, from
which we can learn what it is, what sort of faculties and
powers it possesses&mdash;all without being aware that the
act and utterance of what the soul is really invests it
with that character in our conception and makes it reach
a higher stage of being than it explicitly had before.
</p>

<p>
We must, however, distinguish and keep apart from
the progress here studied what we call education and
instruction. The sphere of education is the individual's
only: and its aim is to bring the universal mind to exist
in them. But in the philosophic theory of mind, mind
is studied as self-instruction and self-education in very
essence; and its acts and utterances are stages in the
process which brings it forward to itself, links it in unity
with itself, and so makes it actual mind.

<head>Sub-Section A. Anthropology. The Soul.</head>

<p>
§ 388. Spirit (Mind) <emph>came into</emph> being as the truth of
Nature. But not merely is it, as such a result, to be
held the true and real first of what went before: this
becoming or transition bears in the sphere of the notion
the special meaning of <q><emph>free judgment</emph>.</q> Mind, thus come
into being, means therefore that Nature in its own self
realises its untruth and sets itself aside: it means that
Mind presupposes itself no longer as the universality
which in corporal individuality is always self-externalised,
but as a universality which in its concretion and totality
is one and simple. At such a stage it is not yet mind,
but <emph>soul</emph>.
</p>

<p>
§ 389. The soul is no separate immaterial entity.
Wherever there is Nature, the soul is its universal
immaterialism, its simple <q>ideal</q> life. Soul is the <emph>substance</emph>
or <q>absolute</q> basis of all the particularising and
individualising of mind: it is in the soul that mind
finds the material on which its character is wrought,
and the soul remains the pervading, identical ideality
of it all. But as it is still conceived thus abstractly, the
soul is only the <emph>sleep</emph> of mind&mdash;the passive νοῦς of
Aristotle, which is potentially all things.
</p>

<p>
The question of the immateriality of the soul has no
interest, except where, on the one hand, matter is
<pb n='013'/><anchor id='Pg013'/>
regarded as something <emph>true</emph>, and mind conceived as a
<emph>thing</emph>, on the other. But in modern times even the
physicists have found matters grow thinner in their
hands: they have come upon <emph>imponderable</emph> matters, like
heat, light, &amp;c., to which they might perhaps add space
and time. These <q>imponderables,</q> which have lost the
property (peculiar to matter) of gravity and, in a sense,
even the capacity of offering resistance, have still, however,
a sensible existence and outness of part to part;
whereas the <emph><q>vital</q> matter</emph>, which may also be found
enumerated among them, not merely lacks gravity, but
even every other aspect of existence which might lead us
to treat it as material. The fact is that in the Idea of
Life the self-externalism of nature is <emph>implicitly</emph> at an end:
subjectivity is the very substance and conception of life&mdash;with
this proviso, however, that its existence or objectivity
is still at the same time forfeited to the sway of
self-externalism. It is otherwise with Mind. There, in
the intelligible unity which exists as freedom, as absolute
negativity, and not as the immediate or natural individual,
the object or the reality of the intelligible unity is the
unity itself; and so the self-externalism, which is the
fundamental feature of matter, has been completely
dissipated and transmuted into universality, or the
subjective ideality of the conceptual unity. Mind is the
existent truth of matter&mdash;the truth that matter itself has
no truth.
</p>

<p>
A cognate question is that of the <emph>community of soul
and body</emph>. This community (interdependence) was
assumed as a <emph>fact</emph>, and the only problem was how to
<emph>comprehend</emph> it. The usual answer, perhaps, was to call
it an <emph>incomprehensible</emph> mystery; and, indeed, if we take
them to be absolutely antithetical and absolutely
independent, they are as impenetrable to each other as
one piece of matter to another, each being supposed
<pb n='014'/><anchor id='Pg014'/>
to be found only in the pores of the other, i.e. where
the other is not: whence Epicurus, when attributing to
the gods a residence in the pores, was consistent in not
imposing on them any connexion with the world.
A somewhat different answer has been given by all
philosophers since this relation came to be expressly
discussed. Descartes, Malebranche, Spinoza, and
Leibnitz have all indicated God as this <foreign rend='italic'>nexus</foreign>. They
meant that the finitude of soul and matter were only
ideal and unreal distinctions; and, so holding, these
philosophers took God, not, as so often is done, merely as
another word for the incomprehensible, but rather as the
sole true identity of finite mind and matter. But either
this identity, as in the case of Spinoza, is too abstract,
or, as in the case of Leibnitz, though his Monad of
monads brings things into being, it does so only by an
act of judgment or choice. Hence, with Leibnitz, the
result is a distinction between soul and the corporeal
(or material), and the identity is only like the <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>copula</foreign> of
a judgment, and does not rise or develop into system,
into the absolute syllogism.
</p>

<p>
§ 390. The Soul is at first&mdash;
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>a</hi>) In its immediate natural mode&mdash;the natural soul,
which only <emph>is</emph>.
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>b</hi>) Secondly, it is a soul which <emph>feels</emph>, as individualised,
enters into correlation with its immediate being, and, in
the modes of that being, retains an abstract independence.
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>c</hi>) Thirdly, its immediate being&mdash;or corporeity&mdash;is
moulded into it, and with that corporeity it exists as
<emph>actual</emph> soul.
</p>

<div>
<head>(a) The Physical Soul<note place='foot'><foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Natürliche Seele.</foreign></note>.</head>

<p>
§ 391. The soul universal, described, it may be, as an
<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>anima mundi</foreign>, a world-soul, must not be fixed on that
<pb n='015'/><anchor id='Pg015'/>
account as a single subject; it is rather the universal
<emph>substance</emph> which has its actual truth only in individuals
and single subjects. Thus, when it presents itself as
a single soul, it is a single soul which <emph>is</emph> merely: its
only modes are modes of natural life. These have, so
to speak, behind its ideality a free existence: i.e. they
are natural objects for consciousness, but objects to
which the soul as such does not behave as to something
external. These features rather are <emph>physical
qualities</emph> of which it finds itself possessed.
</p>

<head>(α) Physical Qualities<note place='foot'><foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Natürliche Qualitäten.</foreign></note>.</head>

<p>
§ 392. While still a <q>substance</q> (i.e. a physical soul)
the mind (1) takes part in the general planetary life,
feels the difference of climates, the changes of the
seasons and the periods of the day, &amp;c. This life of
nature for the main shows itself only in occasional
strain or disturbance of mental tone.
</p>

<p>
In recent times a good deal has been said of the
cosmical, sidereal, and telluric life of man. In such
a sympathy with nature the animals essentially live:
their specific characters and their particular phases of
growth depend, in many cases completely, and always
more or less, upon it. In the case of man these points
of dependence lose importance, just in proportion to his
civilisation, and the more his whole frame of soul is
based upon a substructure of mental freedom. The
history of the world is not bound up with revolutions
in the solar system, any more than the destinies of
individuals with the positions of the planets.
</p>

<p>
The difference of climate has a more solid and
vigorous influence. But the response to the changes
of the seasons and hours of the day is found only in
faint changes of mood, which come expressly to the
<pb n='016'/><anchor id='Pg016'/>
fore only in morbid states (including insanity) and at
periods when the self-conscious life suffers depression.
</p>

<p>
In nations less intellectually emancipated, which
therefore live more in harmony with nature, we find
amid their superstitions and aberrations of imbecility
<emph>a few</emph> real cases of such sympathy, and on that foundation
what seems to be marvellous prophetic vision of
coming conditions and of events arising therefrom.
But as mental freedom gets a deeper hold, even these
few and slight susceptibilities, based upon participation
in the common life of nature, disappear. Animals and
plants, on the contrary, remain for ever subject to such
influences.
</p>

<p>
§ 393. (2) According to the concrete differences of
the terrestrial globe, the general planetary life of the
nature-governed mind specialises itself and breaks up
into the several nature-governed minds which, on the
whole, give expression to the nature of the geographical
continents and constitute the diversities of <emph>race</emph>.
</p>

<p>
The contrast between the earth's poles, the land
towards the north pole being more aggregated and
preponderant over sea, whereas in the southern hemisphere
it runs out in sharp points, widely distant from
each other, introduces into the differences of continents
a further modification which Treviranus (<hi rend='italic'>Biology</hi>, Part
II) has exhibited in the case of the flora and fauna.
</p>

<p>
§ 394. This diversity descends into specialities, that
may be termed <emph>local</emph> minds&mdash;shown in the outward
modes of life and occupation, bodily structure and
disposition, but still more in the inner tendency and
capacity of the intellectual and moral character of the
several peoples.
</p>

<p>
Back to the very beginnings of national history we see
the several nations each possessing a persistent type of
its own.
</p>

<pb n='017'/><anchor id='Pg017'/>

<p>
§ 395. (3) The soul is further de-universalised into
the individualised subject. But this subjectivity is here
only considered as a differentiation and singling out of
the modes which nature gives; we find it as the special
temperament, talent, character, physiognomy, or other
disposition and idiosyncrasy, of families or single
individuals.
</p>

</div>

<div>
<head>(β) Physical Alterations.</head>

<p>
§ 396. Taking the soul as an individual, we find its
diversities, as alterations in it, the one permanent subject,
and as stages in its development. As they are at once
physical and mental diversities, a more concrete definition
or description of them would require us to anticipate
an acquaintance with the formed and matured
mind.
</p>

<p>
The (1) first of these is the natural lapse of the ages
in man's life. He begins with <emph>Childhood</emph>&mdash;mind wrapt up
in itself. His next step is the fully-developed antithesis,
the strain and struggle of a universality which is still
subjective (as seen in ideals, fancies, hopes, ambitions)
against his immediate individuality. And that individuality
marks both the world which, as it exists, fails to
meet his ideal requirements, and the position of the
individual himself, who is still short of independence
and not fully equipped for the part he has to play
(<emph>Youth</emph>). Thirdly, we see man in his true relation to
his environment, recognising the objective necessity
and reasonableness of the world as he finds it,&mdash;a
world no longer incomplete, but able in the work
which it collectively achieves to afford the individual
a place and a security for his performance. By his
share in this collective work he first is really <emph>somebody</emph>,
gaining an effective existence and an objective value
(<emph>Manhood</emph>). Last of all comes the finishing touch to
<pb n='018'/><anchor id='Pg018'/>
this unity with objectivity: a unity which, while on its
realist side it passes into the <emph>inertia</emph> of deadening habit,
on its idealist side gains freedom from the limited
interests and entanglements of the outward present
(<emph>Old Age</emph>).
</p>

<p>
§ 397. (2) Next we find the individual subject to
a <emph>real</emph> antithesis, leading it to seek and find <emph>itself</emph> in
<emph>another</emph> individual. This&mdash;the <emph>sexual relation</emph>&mdash;on a
physical basis, shows, on its one side, subjectivity
remaining in an instinctive and emotional harmony of
moral life and love, and not pushing these tendencies
to an extreme <emph>universal</emph> phase, in purposes political,
scientific or artistic; and on the other, shows an active
half, where the individual is the vehicle of a struggle of
universal and objective interests with the given conditions
(both of his own existence and of that of the
external world), carrying out these universal principles
into a unity with the world which is his own
work. The sexual tie acquires its moral and spiritual
significance and function in the <emph>family</emph>.
</p>

<p>
§ 398. (3) When the individuality, or self-centralised
being, distinguishes itself from its <emph>mere</emph> being, this immediate
judgment is the <emph>waking</emph> of the soul, which confronts
its self-absorbed natural life, in the first instance, as one
natural quality and state confronts another state, viz.
<emph>sleep</emph>.&mdash;The waking is not merely for the observer, or
externally distinct from the sleep: it is itself the <emph>judgment</emph>
(primary partition) of the individual soul&mdash;which
is self-existing only as it relates its self-existence to
its mere existence, distinguishing itself from its still
undifferentiated universality. The waking state includes
generally all self-conscious and rational activity in which
the mind realises its own distinct self.&mdash;Sleep is an
invigoration of this activity&mdash;not as a merely negative
rest from it, but as a return back from the world of
<pb n='019'/><anchor id='Pg019'/>
specialisation, from dispersion into phases where it has
grown hard and stiff,&mdash;a return into the general nature
of subjectivity, which is the substance of those specialised
energies and their absolute master.
</p>

<p>
The distinction between sleep and waking is one of
those <emph>posers</emph>, as they may be called, which are often
addressed to philosophy:&mdash;Napoleon, e.g., on a visit to
the University of Pavia, put this question to the class of
ideology. The characterisation given in the section is
abstract; it primarily treats waking merely as a natural
fact, containing the mental element <foreign rend='italic'>implicite</foreign> but not
yet as invested with a special being of its own. If we are
to speak more concretely of this distinction (in fundamentals
it remains the same), we must take the self-existence
of the individual soul in its higher aspects as
the Ego of consciousness and as intelligent mind. The
difficulty raised anent the distinction of the two states
properly arises, only when we also take into account the
dreams in sleep and describe these dreams, as well as
the mental representations in the sober waking consciousness,
under one and the same title of mental representations.
Thus superficially classified as states of mental
representation the two coincide, because we have lost
sight of the difference; and in the case of any assignable
distinction of waking consciousness, we can always
return to the trivial remark that all this is nothing more
than mental idea. But the concrete theory of the
waking soul in its realised being views it as <emph>consciousness</emph>
and <emph>intellect</emph>: and the world of intelligent consciousness
is something quite different from a picture of mere
ideas and images. The latter are in the main only
externally conjoined, in an unintelligent way, by the
laws of the so-called <emph>Association of Ideas</emph>; though here
and there of course logical principles may also be
operative. But in the waking state man behaves
<pb n='020'/><anchor id='Pg020'/>
essentially as a concrete ego, an intelligence: and
because of this intelligence his sense-perception stands
before him as a concrete totality of features in which
each member, each point, takes up its place as at the
same time determined through and with all the rest.
Thus the facts embodied in his sensation are authenticated,
not by his mere subjective representation and
distinction of the facts as something external from the
person, but by virtue of the concrete interconnexion in
which each part stands with all parts of this complex.
The waking state is the concrete consciousness of this
mutual corroboration of each single factor of its content
by all the others in the picture as perceived. The
consciousness of this interdependence need not be
explicit and distinct. Still this general setting to all
sensations is implicitly present in the concrete feeling
of self.&mdash;In order to see the difference of dreaming and
waking we need only keep in view the Kantian distinction
between subjectivity and objectivity of mental representation
(the latter depending upon determination through
categories): remembering, as already noted, that what
is actually present in mind need not be therefore
explicitly realised in consciousness, just as little as the
exaltation of the intellectual sense to God need stand
before consciousness in the shape of proofs of God's
existence, although, as before explained, these proofs
only serve to express the net worth and content of that
feeling.

<anchor id='Section_399'/>
§ 399. Sleep and waking are, primarily, it is true, not
mere alterations, but <emph>alternating</emph> conditions (a progression
<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>in infinitum</foreign>). This is their formal and
negative relationship: but in it the <emph>affirmative</emph> relationship
<pb n='021'/><anchor id='Pg021'/>
is also involved. In the self-certified existence of
waking soul its mere existence is implicit as an <q>ideal</q>
factor: the features which make up its sleeping nature,
where they are implicitly as in their substance, are
<emph>found</emph> by the waking soul, in its own self, and, be it
noted, for itself. The fact that these particulars, though
as a mode of mind they are distinguished from the
self-identity of our self-centred being, are yet simply
contained in its simplicity, is what we call sensibility.
</p>

<p>
§ 400. Sensibility (feeling) is the form of the dull
stirring, the inarticulate breathing, of the spirit through
its unconscious and unintelligent individuality, where
every definite feature is still <q>immediate,</q>&mdash;neither
specially developed in its content nor set in distinction
as objective to subject, but treated as belonging to its
most special, its natural peculiarity. The content of
sensation is thus limited and transient, belonging as it
does to natural, immediate being,&mdash;to what is therefore
qualitative and finite.
</p>

<p>
<emph>Everything is in sensation</emph> (feeling): if you will, everything
that emerges in conscious intelligence and in
reason has its source and origin in sensation; for
source and origin just means the first immediate
manner in which a thing appears. Let it not be
enough to have principles and religion only in the
head: they must also be in the heart, in the feeling.
What we merely have in the head is in consciousness,
in a general way: the facts of it are objective&mdash;set over
against consciousness, so that as it is put in me (my
abstract ego) it can also be kept away and apart from
me (from my concrete subjectivity). But if put in
the feeling, the fact is a mode of my individuality,
however crude that individuality be in such a form: it
is thus treated as my <emph>very own</emph>. My own is something
inseparate from the actual concrete self: and this
<pb n='022'/><anchor id='Pg022'/>
immediate unity of the soul with its underlying self
in all its definite content is just this inseparability;
which however yet falls short of the ego of developed
consciousness, and still more of the freedom of rational
mind-life. It is with a quite different intensity and
permanency that the will, the conscience, and the
character, are our very own, than can ever be true of
feeling and of the group of feelings (the heart): and
this we need no philosophy to tell us. No doubt it is
correct to say that above everything the <emph>heart</emph> must
be good. But feeling and heart is not the form by
which anything is legitimated as religious, moral, true,
just, &amp;c., and an appeal to heart and feeling either means
nothing or means something bad. This should hardly
need enforcing. Can any experience be more trite than
that feelings and hearts are also bad, evil, godless, mean,
&amp;c.? That the heart is the source only of such feelings
is stated in the words: <q>From the heart proceed evil
thoughts, murder, adultery, fornication, blasphemy, &amp;c.</q>
In such times when <q>scientific</q> theology and philosophy
make the heart and feeling the criterion of what is good,
moral, and religious, it is necessary to remind them
of these trite experiences; just as it is nowadays
necessary to repeat that thinking is the characteristic
property by which man is distinguished from the beasts,
and that he has feeling in common with them.
</p>

<p>
<anchor id='Section_401'/>
§ 401. What the sentient soul finds within it is, on
one hand, the naturally immediate, as <q>ideally</q> in it and
made its own. On the other hand and conversely, what
originally belongs to the central individuality (which as
further deepened and enlarged is the conscious ego and
free mind) get the features of the natural corporeity, and
is so felt. In this way we have two spheres of feeling.
One, where what at first is a corporeal affection (e.g.
of the eye or of any bodily part whatever) is made
<pb n='023'/><anchor id='Pg023'/>
feeling (sensation) by being driven inward, memorised
in the soul's self-centred part. Another, where affections
originating in the mind and belonging to it, are in
order to be felt, and to be as if found, invested with
corporeity. Thus the mode or affection gets a place in
the subject: it is felt in the soul. The detailed specification
of the former branch of sensibility is seen in the
system of the senses. But the other or inwardly originated
modes of feeling no less necessarily systematise
themselves; and their corporisation, as put in the living
and concretely developed natural being, works itself out,
following the special character of the mental mode, in
a special system of bodily organs.
</p>

<p>
Sensibility in general is the healthy fellowship of the
individual mind in the life of its bodily part. The senses
form the simple system of corporeity specified. (<hi rend='italic'>a</hi>) The
<q>ideal</q> side of physical things breaks up into two&mdash;because
in it, as immediate and not yet subjective
ideality, distinction appears as mere variety&mdash;the senses
of definite <emph>light</emph>, § 287&mdash;and of <emph>sound</emph>, § 300. The <q>real</q>
aspect similarly is with its difference double: (<hi rend='italic'>b</hi>) the
senses of smell and taste, §§ 321, 322; (<hi rend='italic'>c</hi>) the sense
of solid reality, of heavy matter, of heat and shape.
Around the centre of the sentient individuality these
specifications arrange themselves more simply than when
they are developed in the natural corporeity.
</p>

<p>
The system by which the internal sensation comes to
give itself specific bodily forms would deserve to be
treated in detail in a peculiar science&mdash;a <emph>psychical physiology</emph>.
Somewhat pointing to such a system is implied
in the feeling of the appropriateness or inappropriateness
of an immediate sensation to the persistent tone of
internal sensibility (the pleasant and unpleasant): as also
in the distinct parallelism which underlies the symbolical
employment of sensations, e.g. of colours, tones, smells.
<pb n='024'/><anchor id='Pg024'/>
But the most interesting side of a psychical physiology
would lie in studying not the mere sympathy, but more
definitely the bodily form adopted by certain mental
modifications, especially the passions or emotions. We
should have, e.g., to explain the line of connexion by which
anger and courage are felt in the breast, the blood, the
<q>irritable</q> system, just as thinking and mental occupation
are felt in the head, the centre of the 'sensible'
system. We should want a more satisfactory explanation
than hitherto of the most familiar connexions by
which tears, and voice in general, with its varieties of
language, laughter, sighs, with many other specialisations
lying in the line of pathognomy and physiognomy,
are formed from their mental source. In physiology
the viscera and the organs are treated merely as parts
subservient to the animal organism; but they form at
the same time a physical system for the expression of
mental states, and in this way they get quite another
interpretation.
</p>

<p>
§ 402. Sensations, just because they are immediate
and are found existing, are single and transient aspects
of psychic life,&mdash;alterations in the substantiality of the
soul, set in its self-centred life, with which that substance
is one. But this self-centred being is not merely
a formal factor of sensation: the soul is virtually
a reflected totality of sensations&mdash;it feels <emph>in itself</emph> the
total substantiality which it <emph>virtually</emph> is&mdash;it is a soul
which feels.
</p>

<p>
In the usage of ordinary language, sensation and
feeling are not clearly distinguished: still we do
not speak of the sensation,&mdash;but of the feeling (sense)
of right, of self; sentimentality (sensibility) is connected
with sensation: we may therefore say sensation emphasises
rather the side of passivity&mdash;the fact that we
find ourselves feeling, i.e. the immediacy of mode in
<pb n='025'/><anchor id='Pg025'/>
feeling&mdash;whereas feeling at the same time rather notes
the fact that it is <emph>we ourselves</emph> who feel.

<div>
<head>(b) The Feeling Soul.&mdash;(Soul as Sentiency.)<note place='foot'><foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Die fühlende Seele.</foreign></note></head>

<p>
§ 403. The feeling or sentient individual is the simple
<q>ideality</q> or subjective side of sensation. What it has
to do, therefore, is to raise its substantiality, its merely
virtual filling-up, to the character of subjectivity, to take
possession of it, to realise its mastery over its own.
As sentient, the soul is no longer a mere natural, but
an inward, individuality: the individuality which in the
merely substantial totality was only formal to it has to
be liberated and made independent.
</p>

<p>
Nowhere so much as in the case of the soul (and
still more of the mind) if we are to understand it, must
that feature of <q>ideality</q> be kept in view, which represents
it as the <emph>negation</emph> of the real, but a negation, where the
real is put past, virtually retained, although it does not
<emph>exist</emph>. The feature is one with which we are familiar in
regard to our mental ideas or to memory. Every
individual is an infinite treasury of sensations, ideas,
acquired lore, thoughts, &amp;c.; and yet the ego is one
and uncompounded, a deep featureless characterless
mine, in which all this is stored up, without existing.
It is only when <emph>I</emph> call to mind <emph>an</emph> idea, that I bring
it out of that interior to existence before consciousness.
Sometimes, in sickness, ideas and information, supposed
to have been forgotten years ago, because for so long
they had not been brought into consciousness, once
more come to light. They were not in our possession,
nor by such reproduction as occurs in sickness do they
for the future come into our possession; and yet they
<pb n='026'/><anchor id='Pg026'/>
were in us and continue to be in us still. Thus a person
can never know how much of things he once learned he
really has in him, should he have once forgotten them:
they belong not to his actuality or subjectivity as such,
but only to his implicit self. And under all the superstructure
of specialised and instrumental consciousness
that may subsequently be added to it, the individuality
always remains this single-souled inner life. At the
present stage this singleness is, primarily, to be defined as
one of feeling&mdash;as embracing the corporeal in itself: thus
denying the view that this body is something material,
with parts outside parts and outside the soul. Just as
the number and variety of mental representations is no
argument for an extended and real multeity in the ego;
so the <q>real</q> outness of parts in the body has no truth
for the sentient soul. As sentient, the soul is characterised
as immediate, and so as natural and corporeal:
but the outness of parts and sensible multiplicity of this
corporeal counts for the soul (as it counts for the
intelligible unity) not as anything real, and therefore
not as a barrier: the soul is this intelligible unity
<emph>in existence</emph>,&mdash;the existent speculative principle. Thus
in the body it is one simple, omnipresent unity.
As to the representative faculty the body is but <emph>one</emph>
representation, and the infinite variety of its material
structure and organisation is reduced to the <emph>simplicity</emph> of
one definite conception: so in the sentient soul, the
corporeity, and all that outness of parts to parts which
belongs to it, is reduced to <emph>ideality</emph> (the <emph>truth</emph> of the
natural multiplicity). The soul is virtually the totality
of nature: as an individual soul it is a monad: it is
itself the explicitly put totality of its particular world,&mdash;that
world being included in it and filling it up; and to
that world it stands but as to itself.
</p>

<p>
§ 404. As <emph>individual</emph>, the soul is exclusive and always
<pb n='027'/><anchor id='Pg027'/>
exclusive: any difference there is, it brings within
itself. What is differentiated from it is as yet no
external object (as in consciousness), but only the
aspects of its own sentient totality, &amp;c. In this partition
(judgment) of itself it is always subject: its object is its
substance, which is at the same time its predicate. This
<emph>substance</emph> is still the content of its natural life, but
turned into the content of the individual sensation-laden
soul; yet as the soul is in that content still particular,
the content is its particular world, so far as that is, in
an implicit mode, included in the ideality of the
subject.
</p>

<p>
By itself, this stage of mind is the stage of its darkness:
its features are not developed to conscious and
intelligent content: so far it is formal and only formal.
It acquires a peculiar interest in cases where it is as
a <emph>form</emph> and appears as a special <emph>state</emph> of mind (§ 350), to
which the soul, which has already advanced to consciousness
and intelligence, may again sink down.
But when a truer phase of mind thus exists in a more
subordinate and abstract one, it implies a want of
adaptation, which is <emph>disease</emph>. In the present stage we
must treat, first, of the abstract psychical modifications
by themselves, secondly, as morbid states of mind:
the latter being only explicable by means of the
former.
</p>

<div>
<head>(α) The Feeling Soul in its Immediacy.</head>

<p>
§ 405. (αα) Though the sensitive individuality is
undoubtedly a monadic individual, it is because
immediate, not yet as <emph>its self</emph> not a true subject
reflected into itself, and is therefore passive. Hence
the individuality of its true self is a different subject
from it&mdash;a subject which may even exist as another
individual. By the self-hood of the latter it&mdash;a substance,
<pb n='028'/><anchor id='Pg028'/>
which is only a non-independent predicate&mdash;is
then set in vibration and controlled without the least
resistance on its part. This other subject by which it
is so controlled may be called its <emph>genius</emph>.
</p>

<p>
In the ordinary course of nature this is the condition
of the child in its mother's womb:&mdash;a condition neither
merely bodily nor merely mental, but psychical&mdash;a
correlation of soul to soul. Here are two individuals,
yet in undivided psychic unity: the one as yet no <emph>self</emph>,
as yet nothing impenetrable, incapable of resistance:
the other is its actuating subject, the <emph>single</emph> self of the
two. The mother is the <emph>genius</emph> of the child; for by
genius we commonly mean the total mental self-hood,
as it has existence of its own, and constitutes the
subjective substantiality of some one else who is only
externally treated as an individual and has only a nominal
independence. The underlying essence of the genius
is the sum total of existence, of life, and of character, not
as a mere possibility, or capacity, or virtuality, but as
efficiency and realised activity, as concrete subjectivity.
</p>

<p>
If we look only to the spatial and material aspects of
the child's existence as an embryo in its special integuments,
and as connected with the mother by means
of umbilical cord, placenta, &amp;c., all that is presented
to the senses and reflection are certain anatomical
and physiological facts&mdash;externalities and instrumentalities
in the sensible and material which are insignificant
as regards the main point, the psychical relationship.
What ought to be noted as regards this psychical
tie are not merely the striking effects communicated
to and stamped upon the child by violent emotions,
injuries, &amp;c. of the mother, but the whole psychical
<emph>judgment</emph> (partition) of the underlying nature, by which
the female (like the monocotyledons among vegetables)
can suffer disruption in twain, so that the child has not
<pb n='029'/><anchor id='Pg029'/>
merely got <emph>communicated</emph> to it, but has originally
received morbid dispositions as well as other pre-dispositions
of shape, temper, character, talent, idiosyncrasies,
&amp;c.
</p>

<p>
Sporadic examples and traces of this <emph>magic</emph> tie appear
elsewhere in the range of self-possessed conscious life,
say between friends, especially female friends with
delicate nerves (a tie which may go so far as to show
<q>magnetic</q> phenomena), between husband and wife
and between members of the same family.
</p>

<p>
The total sensitivity has its self here in a separate
subjectivity, which, in the case cited of this sentient
life in the ordinary course of nature, is visibly present
as another and a different individual. But this sensitive
totality is meant to elevate its self-hood out of itself to
subjectivity in one and the same individual: which
is then its indwelling consciousness, self-possessed,
intelligent, and reasonable. For such a consciousness
the merely sentient life serves as an underlying and
only implicitly existent material; and the self-possessed
subjectivity is the rational, self-conscious, controlling
genius thereof. But this sensitive nucleus includes not
merely the purely unconscious, congenital disposition
and temperament, but within its enveloping simplicity
it acquires and retains also (in habit, as to which
see later) all further ties and essential relationships,
fortunes, principles&mdash;everything in short belonging to
the character, and in whose elaboration self-conscious
activity has most effectively participated. The sensitivity
is thus a soul in which the whole mental life is
condensed. The total individual under this concentrated
aspect is distinct from the existing and actual play of
his consciousness, his secular ideas, developed interests,
inclinations, &amp;c. As contrasted with this looser aggregate
of means and methods the more intensive form of
<pb n='030'/><anchor id='Pg030'/>
individuality is termed the genius, whose decision is
ultimate whatever may be the show of reasons, intentions,
means, of which the more public consciousness is so
liberal. This concentrated individuality also reveals
itself under the aspect of what is called the heart and
soul of feeling. A man is said to be heartless and
unfeeling when he looks at things with self-possession
and acts according to his permanent purposes, be they
great substantial aims or petty and unjust interests: a
good-hearted man, on the other hand, means rather one
who is at the mercy of his individual sentiment, even
when it is of narrow range and is wholly made up
of particularities. Of such good nature or goodness
of heart it may be said that it is less the genius itself
than the <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>indulgere genio</foreign>.
</p>

<p>
§ 406. (ββ) The sensitive life, when it becomes a
<emph>form</emph> or <emph>state</emph> of the self-conscious, educated, self-possessed
human being is a disease. The individual
in such a morbid state stands in direct contact
with the concrete contents of his own self, whilst he
keeps his self-possessed consciousness of self and of
the causal order of things apart as a distinct state of
mind. This morbid condition is seen in <emph>magnetic
somnambulism</emph> and cognate states.
</p>

<p>
In this summary encyclopaedic account it is impossible
to supply a demonstration of what the paragraph states
as the nature of the remarkable condition produced
chiefly by animal magnetism&mdash;to show, in other words,
that it is in harmony with the facts. To that end the
phenomena, so complex in their nature and so very
different one from another, would have first of all to be
brought under their general points of view. The facts,
it might seem, first of all call for verification. But such
a verification would, it must be added, be superfluous
for those on whose account it was called for: for they
<pb n='031'/><anchor id='Pg031'/>
facilitate the inquiry for themselves by declaring the
narratives&mdash;infinitely numerous though they be and
accredited by the education and character of the
witnesses&mdash;to be mere deception and imposture. The
<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>a priori</foreign> conceptions of these inquirers are so rooted
that no testimony can avail against them, and they have
even denied what they had seen with their own eyes.
In order to believe in this department even what one
sees with these eyes, and still more to understand it,
the first requisite is not to be in bondage to the hard
and fast categories of the practical intellect. The chief
points on which the discussion turns may here be
given:
</p>

<p>
(α) To the <emph>concrete</emph> existence of the individual belongs
the aggregate of his fundamental <emph>interests</emph>, both the
essential and the particular empirical ties which connect
him with other men and the world at large. This
totality forms <emph>his</emph> actuality, in the sense that it lies in
fact immanent in him; it has already been called his
<emph>genius</emph>. This genius is not the free mind which wills
and thinks: the form of sensitivity, in which the
individual here appears immersed, is, on the contrary,
a surrender of his self-possessed intelligent existence.
The first conclusion to which these considerations lead,
with reference to the contents of consciousness in the
somnambulist stage, is that it is only the range of his
individually moulded world (of his private interests and
narrow relationships) which appear there. Scientific
theories and philosophic conceptions or general truths
require a different soil,&mdash;require an intelligence which
has risen out of the inarticulate mass of mere sensitivity
to free consciousness. It is foolish therefore to expect
revelations about the higher ideas from the somnambulist
state.
</p>

<p>
(β) Where a human being's senses and intellect are
<pb n='032'/><anchor id='Pg032'/>
sound, he is fully and intelligently alive to that reality
of his which gives concrete filling to his individuality:
but he is awake to it in the form of interconnexion
between himself and the features of that reality conceived
as an external and a separate world, and he is aware that
this world is in itself also a complex of interconnexions
of a practically intelligible kind. In his subjective
ideas and plans he has also before him this causally
connected scheme of things he calls his world and
the series of means which bring his ideas and his
purposes into adjustment with the objective existences,
which are also means and ends to each other. At the
same time, this world which is outside him has its
threads in him to such a degree that it is these threads
which make him what he really is: he too would become
extinct if these externalities were to disappear, unless
by the aid of religion, subjective reason, and character,
he is in a remarkable degree self-supporting and independent
of them. But, then, in the latter case he is less
susceptible of the psychical state here spoken of.&mdash;As
an illustration of that identity with the surroundings
may be noted the effect produced by the death of
beloved relatives, friends, &amp;c. on those left behind, so
that the one dies or pines away with the loss of the
other. (Thus Cato, after the downfall of the Roman
republic, could live no longer: his inner reality was
neither wider than higher than it.) Compare home-sickness,
and the like.
</p>

<p>
(γ) But when all that occupies the waking consciousness,
the world outside it and its relationship to that
world is under a veil, and the soul is thus sunk in sleep
(in magnetic sleep, in catalepsy, and other diseases,
e.g. those connected with female development, or at the
approach of death, &amp;c.), then that <emph>immanent actuality</emph>
of the individual remains the same substantial total
<pb n='033'/><anchor id='Pg033'/>
as before, but now as a purely sensitive life with an
inward vision and an inward consciousness. And because
it is the adult, formed, and developed consciousness which
is degraded into this state of sensitivity, it retains along
with its content a certain nominal self-hood, a formal
vision and awareness, which however does not go so far
as the conscious judgment or discernment by which its
contents, when it is healthy and awake, exist for it as
an outward objectivity. The individual is thus a monad
which is inwardly aware of its actuality&mdash;a genius which
beholds itself. The characteristic point in such knowledge
is that the very same facts (which for the healthy
consciousness are an objective practical reality, and to
know which, in its sober moods, it needs the intelligent
chain of means and conditions in all their real expansion)
are now immediately known and perceived in this immanence.
This perception is a sort of <emph>clairvoyance</emph>; for it is
a consciousness living in the undivided substantiality of
the genius, and finding itself in the very heart of the
interconnexion, and so can dispense with the series of
conditions, external one to another, which lead up to
the result,&mdash;conditions which cool reflection has in
succession to traverse and in so doing feels the limits
of its own individual externality. But such clairvoyance&mdash;just
because its dim and turbid vision does not
present the facts in a rational interconnexion&mdash;is for
that very reason at the mercy of every private contingency
of feeling and fancy, &amp;c.&mdash;not to mention that foreign
<emph>suggestions</emph> (see later) intrude into its vision. It is thus
impossible to make out whether what the clairvoyants
really see preponderates over what they deceive themselves
in.&mdash;But it is absurd to treat this visionary state
as a sublime mental phase and as a truer state, capable
of conveying general truths<note place='foot'>Plato had a better idea of the relation of prophecy generally to
the state of sober consciousness than many moderns, who supposed
that the Platonic language on the subject of enthusiasm authorised
their belief in the sublimity of the revelations of somnambulistic
vision. Plato says in the <hi rend='italic'>Timaeus</hi> (p. 71), <q>The author of our
being so ordered our inferior parts that they too might obtain a
measure of truth, and in the liver placed their oracle (the power of
divination by dreams). And herein is a proof that God has given
the art of divination, not to the wisdom, but, to the foolishness of man;
for no man when in his wits attains prophetic truth and inspiration;
but when he receives the inspired word, either his intelligence is
enthralled by sleep, or he is demented by some distemper or possession
(enthusiasm).</q> Plato very correctly notes not merely the bodily
conditions on which such visionary knowledge depends, and the
possibility of the truth of the dreams, but also the inferiority of
them to the reasonable frame of mind.</note>.
</p>

<pb n='034'/><anchor id='Pg034'/>

<p>
(δ) An essential feature of this sensitivity, with its
absence of intelligent and volitional personality, is this,
that it is a state of passivity, like that of the child in the
womb. The patient in this condition is accordingly
made, and continues to be, subject to the power of
another person, the magnetiser; so that when the two
are thus in psychical <emph>rapport</emph>, the selfless individual,
not really a <q>person,</q> has for his subjective consciousness
the consciousness of the other. This latter self-possessed
individual is thus the effective subjective soul of the
former, and the genius which may even supply him
with a train of ideas. That the somnambulist perceives
in himself tastes and smells which are present in the
person with whom he stands <foreign rend='italic'>en rapport</foreign>, and that he is
aware of the other inner ideas and present perceptions
of the latter as if they were his own, shows the
substantial identity which the soul (which even in
its concreteness is also truly immaterial) is capable of
holding with another. When the substance of both is
thus made one, there is only one subjectivity of
consciousness: the patient has a sort of individuality,
but it is empty, not on the spot, not actual: and this
nominal self accordingly derives its whole stock of ideas
<pb n='035'/><anchor id='Pg035'/>
from the sensations and ideas of the other, in whom it
sees, smells, tastes, reads, and hears. It is further to
be noted on this point that the somnambulist is thus
brought into <emph>rapport</emph> with two genii and a twofold set of
ideas, his own and that of the magnetiser. But it is
impossible to say precisely which sensations and which
visions he, in this nominal perception, receives, beholds
and brings to knowledge from his own inward self, and
which from the suggestions of the person with whom
he stands in relation. This uncertainty may be the
source of many deceptions, and accounts among other
things for the diversity that inevitably shows itself
among somnambulists from different countries and
under <emph>rapport</emph> with persons of different education, as
regards their views on morbid states and the methods
of cure, or medicines for them, as well as on scientific
and intellectual topics.
</p>

<p>
(ε) As in this sensitive substantiality there is no contrast
to external objectivity, so within itself the subject
is so entirely one that all varieties of sensation
have disappeared, and hence, when the activity of the
sense-organs is asleep, the <q>common sense,</q> or <q>general
feeling</q> specifies itself to several functions; one sees
and hears with the fingers, and especially with the pit of
the stomach, &amp;c.
</p>

<p>
To comprehend a thing means in the language of
practical intelligence to be able to trace the series of
means intervening between a phenomenon and some
other existence on which it depends,&mdash;to discover what
is called the ordinary course of nature, in compliance
with the laws and relations of the intellect, e.g. causality,
reasons, &amp;c. The purely sensitive life, on the contrary,
even when it retains that mere nominal consciousness,
as in the morbid state alluded to, is just this form of
immediacy, without any distinctions between subjective
<pb n='036'/><anchor id='Pg036'/>
and objective, between intelligent personality and objective
world, and without the aforementioned finite ties
between them. Hence to understand this intimate conjunction,
which, though all-embracing, is without any
definite points of attachment, is impossible, so long as
we assume independent personalities, independent one
of another and of the objective world which is their
content&mdash;so long as we assume the absolute spatial and
material externality of one part of being to another.

<p>
§ 407. (αα) The sensitive totality is, in its capacity of
individual, essentially the tendency to distinguish itself
in itself, and to wake up to the <emph>judgment in itself</emph>, in
virtue of which it has <emph>particular</emph> feelings and stands as
a <emph>subject</emph> in respect of these aspects of itself. The subject
as such gives these feelings a place as <emph>its own</emph> in
itself. In these private and personal sensations it is
immersed, and at the same time, because of the <q>ideality</q>
of the particulars, it combines itself in them with itself
as a subjective unit. In this way it is <emph>self-feeling</emph>, and is
so at the same time only in the <emph>particular feeling</emph>.
</p>

<p>
§ 408. (ββ) In consequence of the immediacy, which
still marks the self-feeling, i.e. in consequence of the
element of corporeality which is still undetached from
the mental life, and as the feeling too is itself particular
and bound up with a special corporeal form, it follows
that although the subject has been brought to acquire
intelligent consciousness, it is still susceptible of disease,
so far as to remain fast in a <emph>special</emph> phase of its self-feeling,
unable to refine it to <q>ideality</q> and get the better
of it. The fully-furnished self of intelligent consciousness
is a conscious subject, which is consistent in itself
<pb n='037'/><anchor id='Pg037'/>
according to an order and behaviour which follows from
its individual position and its connexion with the external
world, which is no less a world of law. But when it is
engrossed with a single phase of feeling, it fails to
assign that phase its proper place and due subordination
in the individual system of the world which a conscious
subject is. In this way the subject finds itself in
contradiction between the totality systematised in its
consciousness, and the single phase or fixed idea which
is not reduced to its proper place and rank. This is
Insanity or mental Derangement.
</p>

<p>
In considering insanity we must, as in other cases,
anticipate the full-grown and intelligent conscious subject,
which is at the same time the <emph>natural</emph> self of <emph>self-feeling</emph>.
In such a phase the self can be liable to the
contradiction between its own free subjectivity and
a particularity which, instead of being <q>idealised</q> in the
former, remains as a fixed element in self-feeling. Mind
as such is free, and therefore not susceptible of this
malady. But in older metaphysics mind was treated as
a soul, as a thing; and it is only as a thing, i.e. as
something natural and existent, that it is liable to
insanity&mdash;the settled fixture of some finite element in it.
Insanity is therefore a psychical disease, i.e. a disease
of body and mind alike: the commencement may
appear to start from one more than other, and so
also may the cure.
</p>

<p>
The self-possessed and healthy subject has an active
and present consciousness of the ordered whole of his
individual world, into the system of which he subsumes
each special content of sensation, idea, desire, inclination,
&amp;c., as it arises, so as to insert them in their
proper place. He is the <emph>dominant genius</emph> over these
particularities. Between this and insanity the difference
is like that between waking and dreaming: only that in
<pb n='038'/><anchor id='Pg038'/>
insanity the dream falls within the waking limits, and
so makes part of the actual self-feeling. Error and that
sort of thing is a proposition consistently admitted to
a place in the objective interconnexion of things. In
the concrete, however, it is often difficult to say where
it begins to become derangement. A violent, but groundless
and senseless outburst of hatred, &amp;c., may, in
contrast to a presupposed higher self-possession and
stability of character, make its victim seem to be beside
himself with frenzy. But the main point in derangement
is the contradiction which a feeling with a fixed
corporeal embodiment sets up against the whole mass of
adjustments forming the concrete consciousness. The
mind which is in a condition of mere <emph>being</emph>, and where
such being is not rendered fluid in its consciousness, is
diseased. The contents which are set free in this reversion
to mere nature are the self-seeking affections of the
heart, such as vanity, pride, and the rest of the passions&mdash;fancies
and hopes&mdash;merely personal love and hatred.
When the influence of self-possession and of general
principles, moral and theoretical, is relaxed, and ceases
to keep the natural temper under lock and key, the
earthly elements are set free&mdash;that evil which is always
latent in the heart, because the heart as immediate is
natural and selfish. It is the evil genius of man which
gains the upper hand in insanity, but in distinction
from and contrast to the better and more intelligent
part, which is there also. Hence this state is mental
derangement and distress. The right psychical treatment
therefore keeps in view the truth that insanity is
not an abstract <emph>loss</emph> of reason (neither in the point of
intelligence nor of will and its responsibility), but only
derangement, only a contradiction in a still subsisting
reason;&mdash;just as physical disease is not an abstract,
i.e. mere and total, loss of health (if it were that, it
<pb n='039'/><anchor id='Pg039'/>
would be death), but a contradiction in it. This humane
treatment, no less benevolent than reasonable (the
services of Pinel towards which deserve the highest
acknowledgment), presupposes the patient's rationality,
and in that assumption has the sound basis for dealing
with him on this side&mdash;just as in the case of bodily
disease the physician bases his treatment on the vitality
which as such still contains health.

<p>
§ 409. Self-feeling, immersed in the detail of the feelings
(in simple sensations, and also desires, instincts,
passions, and their gratification), is undistinguished
from them. But in the self there is latent a simple
self-relation of ideality, a nominal universality (which
is the truth of these details): and as so universal,
the self is to be stamped upon, and made appear in, this
life of feeling, yet so as to distinguish itself from the
particular details, and be a realised universality. But
this universality is not the full and sterling truth of the
specific feelings and desires; what they specifically
contain is as yet left out of account. And so too the
particularity is, as now regarded, equally formal; it
counts only as the <emph>particular being</emph> or immediacy of the
soul in opposition to its equally formal and abstract
realisation. This particular being of the soul is the
factor of its corporeity; here we have it breaking with
this corporeity, distinguishing it from itself,&mdash;itself
a <emph>simple</emph> being,&mdash;and becoming the <q>ideal,</q> subjective
substantiality of it,&mdash;just as in its latent notion (§ 359)
it was the substance, and the mere substance, of it.
</p>

<p>
But this abstract realisation of the soul in its corporeal
vehicle is not yet the self&mdash;not the existence of the
<pb n='040'/><anchor id='Pg040'/>
universal which is for the universal. It is the corporeity
reduced to its mere <emph>ideality</emph>; and so far only
does corporeity belong to the soul as such. That is
to say, as space and time&mdash;the abstract one-outside-another,
as, in short, empty space and empty time&mdash;are
only subjective form&mdash;pure act of intuition; so that pure
being (which through the supersession in it of the
particularity of the corporeity, or of the immediate corporeity
as such has realised itself) is mere intuition and
no more, lacking consciousness, but the basis of consciousness.
And consciousness it becomes, when the
corporeity, of which it is the subjective substance, and
which still continues to exist, and that as a barrier for
it, has been absorbed by it, and it has been invested
with the character of self-centred subject.
</p>

<p>
§ 410. The soul's making itself an abstract universal
being, and reducing the particulars of feelings (and of
consciousness) to a mere feature of its being is Habit.
In this manner the soul has the contents in possession,
and contains them in such manner that in these features
it is not as sentient, nor does it stand in relationship
with them as distinguishing itself from them, nor is
absorbed in them, but has them and moves in them,
without feeling or consciousness of the fact. The soul
is freed from them, so far as it is not interested in or
occupied with them: and whilst existing in these forms
as its possession, it is at the same time open to be
otherwise occupied and engaged&mdash;say with feeling and
with mental consciousness in general.
</p>

<p>
This process of building up the particular and corporeal
expressions of feeling into the being of the soul
appears as a <emph>repetition</emph> of them, and the generation of
habit as <emph>practice</emph>. For, this being of the soul, if in
respect of the natural particular phase it be called an
abstract universality to which the former is transmuted,
<pb n='041'/><anchor id='Pg041'/>
is a reflexive universality (§ 175); i.e. the one and the
same, that recurs in a series of units of sensation, is reduced
to unity, and this abstract unity expressly stated.
</p>

<p>
Habit, like memory, is a difficult point in mental
organisation: habit is the mechanism of self-feeling, as
memory is the mechanism of intelligence. The natural
qualities and alterations of age, sleep and waking, are
<q>immediately</q> natural: habit, on the contrary, is the
mode of feeling (as well as intelligence, will, &amp;c., so far
as they belong to self-feeling) made into a natural and
mechanical existence. Habit is rightly called a second
nature; nature, because it is an immediate being of the
soul; a second nature, because it is an immediacy
created by the soul, impressing and moulding the corporeality
which enters into the modes of feeling as such
and into the representations and volitions so far as
they have taken corporeal form (§ <ref target='Section_401'>401</ref>).
</p>

<p>
In habit the human being's mode of existence is
<q>natural,</q> and for that reason not free; but still free, so
far as the merely natural phase of feeling is by habit
reduced to a mere being of <emph>his</emph>, and he is no longer
involuntarily attracted or repelled by it, and so no
longer interested, occupied, or dependent in regard to
it. The want of freedom in habit is partly merely
formal, as habit merely attaches to the being of the soul;
partly only relative, so far as it strictly speaking arises
only in the case of bad habits, or so far as a habit is
opposed by another purpose: whereas the habit of
right and goodness is an embodiment of liberty. The
main point about Habit is that by its means man gets
emancipated from the feelings, even in being affected
by them. The different forms of this may be described
as follows: (α) The <emph>immediate</emph> feeling is negated and
treated as indifferent. One who gets inured against
external sensations (frost, heat, weariness of the limbs,
<pb n='042'/><anchor id='Pg042'/>
&amp;c., sweet tastes, &amp;c.), and who hardens the heart
against misfortune, acquires a strength which consists
in this, that although the frost, &amp;c.&mdash;or the misfortune&mdash;is
felt, the affection is deposed to a mere externality
and immediacy; the universal psychical life keeps
its own abstract independence in it, and the self-feeling
as such, consciousness, reflection, and any other
purposes and activity, are no longer bothered with it.
(β) There is indifference towards the satisfaction: the
desires and impulses are by the <emph>habit</emph> of their satisfaction
deadened. This is the rational liberation from them;
whereas monastic renunciation and forcible interference
do not free from them, nor are they in conception
rational. Of course in all this it is assumed that the
impulses are kept as the finite modes they naturally
are, and that they, like their satisfaction, are subordinated
as partial factors to the reasonable will. (γ) In
habit regarded as <emph>aptitude</emph>, or skill, not merely has the
abstract psychical life to be kept intact <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>per se</foreign>, but it has
to be imposed as a subjective aim, to be made a power
in the bodily part, which is rendered subject and
thoroughly pervious to it. Conceived as having the
inward purpose of the subjective soul thus imposed upon
it, the body is treated as an immediate externality and
a barrier. Thus comes out the more decided rupture
between the soul as simple self-concentration, and its
earlier naturalness and immediacy; it has lost its
original and immediate identity with the bodily nature,
and as external has first to be reduced to that position.
Specific feelings can only get bodily shape in a perfectly
specific way (§ <ref target='Section_401'>401</ref>); and the immediate portion of body
is a particular possibility for a specific aim (a particular
aspect of its differentiated structure, a particular organ
of its organic system). To mould such an aim in the
organic body is to bring out and express the <q>ideality</q>
<pb n='043'/><anchor id='Pg043'/>
which is implicit in matter always, and especially so in
the specific bodily part, and thus to enable the soul,
under its volitional and conceptual characters, to exist
as substance in its corporeity. In this way an aptitude
shows the corporeity rendered completely pervious,
made into an instrument, so that when the conception
(e.g. a series of musical notes) is in me, then without
resistance and with ease the body gives them correct
utterance.
</p>

<p>
The form of habit applies to all kinds and grades of
mental action. The most external of them, i.e. the
spatial direction of an individual, viz. his upright
posture, has been by will made a habit&mdash;a position
taken without adjustment and without consciousness&mdash;which
continues to be an affair of his persistent will;
for the man stands only because and in so far as he
wills to stand, and only so long as he wills it without
consciousness. Similarly our eyesight is the concrete
habit which, without an express adjustment, combines
in a single act the several modifications of sensation,
consciousness, intuition, intelligence, &amp;c., which make
it up. Thinking, too, however free and active in its
own pure element it becomes, no less requires habit
and familiarity (this impromptuity or form of immediacy),
by which it is the property of my single self where I can
freely and in all directions range. It is through this
habit that I come to realise my <emph>existence</emph> as a thinking
being. Even here, in this spontaneity of self-centred
thought, there is a partnership of soul and body (hence,
want of habit and too-long-continued thinking cause
headache); habit diminishes this feeling, by making
the natural function an immediacy of the soul. Habit
on an ampler scale, and carried out in the strictly
intellectual range, is recollection and memory, whereof
we shall speak later.
</p>

<pb n='044'/><anchor id='Pg044'/>

<p>
Habit is often spoken of disparagingly and called lifeless,
casual and particular. And it is true that the form
of habit, like any other, is open to anything we chance
to put into it; and it is habit of living which brings on
death, or, if quite abstract, is death itself: and yet habit
is indispensable for the <emph>existence</emph> of all intellectual life
in the individual, enabling the subject to be a concrete
immediacy, an <q>ideality</q> of soul&mdash;enabling the matter
of consciousness, religious, moral, &amp;c., to be his as <emph>this</emph>
self, <emph>this</emph> soul, and no other, and be neither a mere
latent possibility, nor a transient emotion or idea, nor
an abstract inwardness, cut off from action and reality,
but part and parcel of his being. In scientific studies
of the soul and the mind, habit is usually passed over&mdash;either
as something contemptible&mdash;or rather for the
further reason that it is one of the most difficult
questions of psychology.

<head>(c) The Actual Soul.<note place='foot'><foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Die wirkliche Seele.</foreign></note></head>

<p>
<anchor id='Section_411'/>
§ 411. The Soul, when its corporeity has been moulded
and made thoroughly its own, finds itself there a <emph>single</emph>
subject; and the corporeity is an externality which stands
as a predicate, in being related to which, it is related
to itself. This externality, in other words, represents
not itself, but the soul, of which it is the <emph>sign</emph>. In this
identity of interior and exterior, the latter subject to the
former, the soul is <emph>actual</emph>: in its corporeity it has its
free shape, in which it <emph>feels itself</emph> and makes <emph>itself felt</emph>,
and which as the Soul's work of art has <emph>human</emph> pathognomic
and physiognomic expression.
</p>

<p>
Under the head of human expression are included,
e.g., the upright figure in general, and the formation of
the limbs, especially the hand, as the absolute instrument,
<pb n='045'/><anchor id='Pg045'/>
of the mouth&mdash;laughter, weeping, &amp;c., and the note of
mentality diffused over the whole, which at once
announces the body at the externality of a higher nature.
This note is so slight, indefinite, and inexpressible a
modification, because the figure in its externality is
something immediate and natural, and can therefore
only be an indefinite and quite imperfect sign for the
mind, unable to represent it in its actual universality.
Seen from the animal world, the human figure is the
supreme phase in which mind makes an appearance.
But for the mind it is only its first appearance, while
language is its perfect expression. And the human
figure, though its proximate phase of existence, is at the
same time in its physiognomic and pathognomic quality
something contingent to it. To try to raise physiognomy
and above all cranioscopy (phrenology) to the rank of
sciences, was therefore one of the vainest fancies, still
vainer than a <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>signatura rerum</foreign>, which supposed the
shape of a plant to afford indication of its medicinal
virtue.
</p>

<p>
§ 412. Implicitly the soul shows the untruth and
unreality of matter; for the soul, in its concentrated
self, cuts itself off from its immediate being, placing the
latter over against it as a corporeity incapable of offering
resistance to its moulding influence. The soul, thus
setting in opposition its being to its (conscious) self,
absorbing it, and making it its own, has lost the meaning
of mere soul, or the <q>immediacy</q> of mind. The actual
soul with its sensation and its concrete self-feeling
turned into habit, has implicitly realised the 'ideality' of
its qualities; in this externality it has recollected and
inwardised itself, and is infinite self-relation. This free
universality thus made explicit shows the soul awaking
to the higher stage of the ego, or abstract universality
in so far as it is <emph>for</emph> the abstract universality. In this
<pb n='046'/><anchor id='Pg046'/>
way it gains the position of thinker and subject&mdash;specially
a subject of the judgment in which the ego
excludes from itself the sum total of its merely natural
features as an object, a world external to it,&mdash;but with
such respect to that object that in it it is immediately
reflected into itself. Thus soul rises to become
<emph>Consciousness</emph>.

<head>Sub-Section B. Phenomenology Of Mind. Consciousness.</head>

<p>
<anchor id='Section_413'/>
§ 413. Consciousness constitutes the reflected or correlational
grade of mind: the grade of mind as <emph>appearance</emph>.
<emph>Ego</emph> is infinite self-relation of mind, but as subjective
or as self-certainty. The immediate identity of the
natural soul has been raised to this pure <q>ideal</q> self-identity;
and what the former <emph>contained</emph> is for this self-subsistent
reflection set forth as an <emph>object</emph>. The pure
abstract freedom of mind lets go from it its specific
qualities,&mdash;the soul's natural life&mdash;to an equal freedom as
an independent <emph>object</emph>. It is of this latter, as external to
it, that the <emph>ego</emph> is in the first instance aware (conscious),
and as such it is Consciousness. Ego, as this absolute
negativity, is implicitly the identity in the otherness:
the <emph>ego</emph> is itself that other and stretches over the object
(as if that object were implicitly cancelled)&mdash;it is one
side of the relationship and the whole relationship&mdash;the
light, which manifests itself and something else
too.
</p>

<p>
<anchor id='Section_414'/>
§ 414. The self-identity of the mind, thus first made
<pb n='048'/><anchor id='Pg048'/>
explicit as the Ego, is only its abstract formal identity.
As <emph>soul</emph> it was under the phase of <emph>substantial</emph> universality;
now, as subjective reflection in itself, it is referred
to this substantiality as to its negative, something dark
and beyond it. Hence consciousness, like reciprocal
dependence in general, is the contradiction between the
independence of the two sides and their identity in
which they are merged into one. The mind as ego is
<emph>essence</emph>; but since reality, in the sphere of essence, is
represented as in immediate being and at the same time
as <q>ideal,</q> it is as consciousness only the <emph>appearance</emph>
(phenomenon) of mind.
</p>

<p>
<anchor id='Section_415'/>
§ 415. As the ego is by itself only a formal identity,
the dialectical movement of its intelligible unity, i.e. the
successive steps in further specification of consciousness,
does not to it seem to be its own activity, but is implicit,
and to the ego it seems an alteration of the object.
Consciousness consequently appears differently modified
according to the difference of the given object; and
the gradual specification of consciousness appears as a
variation in the characteristics of its objects. Ego, the
subject of consciousness, is thinking: the logical process
of modifying the object is what is identical in subject
and object, their absolute interdependence, what makes
the object the subject's own.
</p>

<p>
The Kantian philosophy may be most accurately
described as having viewed the mind as consciousness,
and as containing the propositions only of a <emph>phenomenology</emph>
(not of a <emph>philosophy</emph>) of mind. The Ego Kant
regards as reference to something away and beyond
(which in its abstract description is termed the thing-at-itself);
and it is only from this finite point of view that
he treats both intellect and will. Though in the notion
of a power of <emph>reflective</emph> judgment he touches upon the
<emph>Idea</emph> of mind&mdash;a subject-objectivity, an <emph>intuitive intellect</emph>,
<pb n='049'/><anchor id='Pg049'/>
&amp;c., and even the Idea of Nature, still this Idea is again
deposed to an appearance, i.e. to a subjective maxim
(§ 58). Reinhold may therefore be said to have correctly
appreciated Kantism when he treated it as a theory of
consciousness (under the name of <q>faculty of ideation</q>).
Fichte kept to the same point of view: his non-ego is only
something set over against the ego, only defined as in <emph>consciousness</emph>:
it is made no more than an infinite <q>shock,</q>
i.e. a thing-in-itself. Both systems therefore have clearly
not reached the intelligible unity or the mind as it
actually and essentially is, but only as it is in reference
to something else.
</p>

<p>
As against Spinozism, again, it is to be noted that the
mind in the judgment by which it <q>constitutes</q> itself an
ego (a free subject contrasted with its qualitative affection)
has emerged from substance, and that the philosophy,
which gives this judgment as the absolute characteristic
of mind, has emerged from Spinozism.
</p>

<p>
§ 416. The aim of conscious mind is to make its
appearance identical with its essence, to raise its <emph>self-certainty
to truth</emph>. The <emph>existence</emph> of mind in the stage of
consciousness is finite, because it is merely a nominal
self-relation, or mere certainty. The object is only
abstractly characterised as <emph>its</emph>; in other words, in the
object it is only as an abstract ego that the mind is
reflected into itself: hence its existence there has still
a content, which is not as its own.
</p>

<p>
§ 417. The grades of this elevation of certainty to
truth are three in number: first (<hi rend='italic'>a</hi>) consciousness in
general, with an object set against it; (<hi rend='italic'>b</hi>) self-consciousness,
for which <emph>ego</emph> is the object; (<hi rend='italic'>c</hi>) unity of consciousness
and self-consciousness, where the mind sees itself
embodied in the object and sees itself as implicitly
and explicitly determinate, as Reason, the <emph>notion</emph> of
mind.

immediate, an existent, reflected in itself, is further
characterised as immediately singular. This is sense-consciousness.
</p>

<p>
Consciousness&mdash;as a case of correlation&mdash;comprises
only the categories belonging to the abstract ego or
formal thinking; and these it treats as features of the
object (§ <ref target='Section_415'>415</ref>). Sense-consciousness therefore is aware
of the object as an existent, a something, an existing
thing, a singular, and so on. It appears as wealthiest
in matter, but as poorest in thought. That wealth of
matter is made out of sensations: they are the <emph>material</emph>
of consciousness (§ <ref target='Section_414'>414</ref>), the substantial and qualitative,
what the soul in its anthropological sphere is and finds
<emph>in itself</emph>. This material the ego (the reflection of the
soul in itself) separates from itself, and puts it first
under the category of being. Spatial and temporal
Singularness, <emph>here</emph> and <emph>now</emph> (the terms by which
in the Phenomenology of the Mind (W. II. p. 73),
I described the object of sense-consciousness) strictly
belongs to <emph>intuition</emph>. At present the object is at first to
be viewed only in its correlation to <emph>consciousness</emph>, i.e.
a something <emph>external</emph> to it, and not yet as external on
its own part, or as being beside and out of itself.
</p>

<p>
§ 419. The <emph>sensible</emph> as somewhat becomes an <emph>other</emph>: the
reflection in itself of this <emph>somewhat</emph>, the <emph>thing</emph>, has <emph>many</emph>
properties; and as a single (thing) in its immediacy has
several <emph>predicates</emph>. The muchness of the sense-singular
<pb n='051'/><anchor id='Pg051'/>
thus becomes a breadth&mdash;a variety of relations, reflectional
attributes, and universalities. These are logical
terms introduced by the thinking principle, i.e. in this
case by the Ego, to describe the sensible. But the Ego
as itself apparent sees in all this characterisation
a change in the object; and self-consciousness, so construing
the object, is sense-perception.

<p>
§ 420. Consciousness, having passed beyond the
sensibility, wants to take the object in its truth, not as
merely immediate, but as mediated, reflected in itself,
and universal. Such an object is a combination of
sense qualities with attributes of wider range by which
thought defines concrete relations and connexions.
Hence the identity of consciousness with the object
passes from the abstract identity of <q>I am sure</q> to the
definite identity of <q>I know, and am aware.</q>
</p>

<p>
The particular grade of consciousness on which
Kantism conceives the mind is perception: which is also
the general point of view taken by ordinary consciousness,
and more or less by the sciences. The sensuous
certitudes of single apperceptions or observations form
the starting-point: these are supposed to be elevated to
truth, by being regarded in their bearings, reflected
upon, and on the lines of definite categories turned at
the same time into something necessary and universal,
viz. <emph>experiences</emph>.
</p>

<p>
§ 421. This conjunction of individual and universal is
admixture&mdash;the individual remains at the bottom hard
and unaffected by the universal, to which however it is
related. It is therefore a tissue of contradictions&mdash;between
the single things of sense apperception, which
form the alleged ground of general experience, and the
<pb n='052'/><anchor id='Pg052'/>
universality which has a higher claim to be the essence
and ground&mdash;between the individuality of a thing which,
taken in its concrete content, constitutes its independence
and the various properties which, free from
this negative link and from one another, are independent
universal <emph>matters</emph> (§ 123). This contradiction of the
finite which runs through all forms of the logical
spheres turns out most concrete, when the somewhat is
defined as <emph>object</emph> (§ 194 seqq.).

<head>(γ) The Intellect<note place='foot'><foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Der Verstand.</foreign></note>.</head>

<p>
§ 422. The proximate <emph>truth</emph> of perception is that it is
the object which is an <emph>appearance</emph>, and that the object's
reflection in self is on the contrary a self-subsistent
inward and universal. The consciousness of such an
object is <emph>intellect</emph>. This inward, as we called it, of the thing
is on one hand the suppression of the multiplicity of
the sensible, and, in that manner, an abstract identity: on
the other hand, however, it also for that reason contains
the multiplicity, but as an interior <q>simple</q> difference,
which remains self-identical in the vicissitudes of appearance.
This simple difference is the realm of <emph>the laws</emph> of
the phenomena&mdash;a copy of the phenomenon, but brought
to rest and universality.
</p>

<p>
<anchor id='Section_423'/>
§ 423. The law, at first stating the mutual dependence
of universal, permanent terms, has, in so far as
its distinction is the inward one, its necessity on its own
part; the one of the terms, as not externally different
from the other, lies immediately in the other. But in
this manner the interior distinction is, what it is in
truth, the distinction on its own part, or the distinction
which is none. With this new form-characteristic, on
the whole, consciousness <emph>implicitly</emph> vanishes: for consciousness
as such implies the reciprocal independence
<pb n='053'/><anchor id='Pg053'/>
of subject and object. The ego in its judgment has
an object which is not distinct from it,&mdash;it has itself.
Consciousness has passed into self-consciousness.

<head>(b) Self-consciousness<note place='foot'><foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Selbstbewußtsein.</foreign></note>.</head>

<p>
§ 424. <emph>Self-consciousness</emph> is the truth of consciousness:
the latter is a consequence of the former, all consciousness
of an other object being as a matter of fact also
self-consciousness. The object is my idea: I am aware
of the object as mine; and thus in it I am aware of me.
The formula of self-consciousness is I = I:&mdash;abstract
freedom, pure <q>ideality.</q> In so far it lacks <q>reality</q>:
for as it is its own object, there is strictly speaking no
object, because there is no distinction between it and
the object.
</p>

<p>
§ 425. Abstract self-consciousness is the first negation
of consciousness, and for that reason it is burdened
with an external object, or, nominally, with the negation
of it. Thus it is at the same time the antecedent
stage, consciousness: it is the contradiction of
itself as self-consciousness and as consciousness. But
the latter aspect and the negation in general is in I = I
potentially suppressed; and hence as this certitude of
self against the object it is the <emph>impulse</emph> to realise its
implicit nature, by giving its abstract self-awareness
content and objectivity, and in the other direction to
free itself from its sensuousness, to set aside the given
objectivity and identify it with itself. The two processes
are one and the same, the identification of its consciousness
and self-consciousness.
</p>

<div>
<head>(α) Appetite or Instinctive Desire<note place='foot'><foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Die Begierde.</foreign></note>.</head>

<p>
§ 426. Self-consciousness, in its immediacy, is a singular,
and a desire (appetite),&mdash;the contradiction implied
<pb n='054'/><anchor id='Pg054'/>
in its abstraction which should yet be objective,&mdash;or
in its immediacy which has the shape of an external
object and should be subjective. The certitude of one's
self, which issues from the suppression of mere consciousness,
pronounces the <emph>object</emph> null: and the outlook
of self-consciousness towards the object equally qualifies
the abstract ideality of such self-consciousness as null.
</p>

<p>
§ 427. Self-consciousness, therefore, knows itself implicit
in the object, which in this outlook is conformable
to the appetite. In the negation of the two one-sided
moments by the ego's own activity, this identity comes
to be <emph>for</emph> the ego. To this activity the object, which
implicitly and for self-consciousness is self-less, can
make no resistance: the dialectic, implicit in it, towards
self-suppression exists in this case as that activity of the
ego. Thus while the given object is rendered subjective,
the subjectivity divests itself of its one-sidedness and
becomes objective to itself.
</p>

<p>
§ 428. The product of this process is the fast conjunction
of the ego with itself, its satisfaction realised, and
itself made actual. On the external side it continues, in
this return upon itself, primarily describable as an individual,
and maintains itself as such; because its bearing
upon the self-less object is purely negative, the latter,
therefore, being merely consumed. Thus appetite in its
satisfaction is always destructive, and in its content
selfish: and as the satisfaction has only happened in
the individual (and that is transient) the appetite is again
generated in the very act of satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
§ 429. But on the inner side, or implicitly, the sense
of self which the ego gets in the satisfaction does not
remain in abstract self-concentration or in mere individuality;
on the contrary,&mdash;as negation of <emph>immediacy</emph>
and individuality the result involves a character of
universality and of the identity of self-consciousness
<pb n='055'/><anchor id='Pg055'/>
with its object. The judgment or diremption of this
self-consciousness is the consciousness of a <q><emph>free</emph></q> object,
in which ego is aware of itself as an ego, which however
is <emph>also</emph> still outside it.

<p>
<anchor id='Section_430'/>
§ 430. Here there is a self-consciousness for a self-consciousness,
at first immediately as one of two things
for another. In that other as ego I behold myself,
and yet also an immediately existing object, another
ego absolutely independent of me and opposed to me.
(The suppression of the singleness of self-consciousness
was only a first step in the suppression, and it merely
led to the characterisation of it as <emph>particular</emph>.) This
contradiction gives either self-consciousness the impulse
to <emph>show</emph> itself as a free self, and to exist as such for
the other:&mdash;the process of <emph>recognition</emph>.
</p>

<p>
§ 431. The process is a battle. I cannot be aware of
me as myself in another individual, so long as I see in
that other an other and an immediate existence: and
I am consequently bent upon the suppression of this
immediacy of his. But in like measure <emph>I</emph> cannot be
recognised as immediate, except so far as I overcome
the mere immediacy on my own part, and thus give
existence to my freedom. But this immediacy is at the
same time the corporeity of self-consciousness, in which
as in its sign and tool the latter has its own <emph>sense of
self</emph>, and its being <emph>for others</emph>, and the means for entering
into relation with them.
</p>

<p>
§ 432. The fight of recognition is a life and death
struggle: either self-consciousness imperils the other's
like, and incurs a like peril for its own&mdash;but only peril,
for either is no less bent on maintaining his life, as the
existence of his freedom. Thus the death of one,
<pb n='056'/><anchor id='Pg056'/>
though by the abstract, therefore rude, negation of
immediacy, it, from one point of view, solves the contradiction,
is yet, from the essential point of view (i.e.
the outward and visible recognition), a new contradiction
(for that recognition is at the same time undone by the
other's death) and a greater than the other.
</p>

<p>
§ 433. But because life is as requisite as liberty to the
solution, the fight ends in the first instance as a one-sided
negation with inequality. While the one combatant
prefers life, retains his single self-consciousness,
but surrenders his claim for recognition, the other holds
fast to his self-assertion and is recognised by the former
as his superior. Thus arises the status of <emph>master and
slave</emph>.
</p>

<p>
In the battle for recognition and the subjugation
under a master, we see, on their phenomenal side, the
emergence of man's social life and the commencement
of political union. <emph>Force</emph>, which is the basis of this
phenomenon, is not on that account a basis of right, but
only the necessary and legitimate factor in the passage
from the state of self-consciousness sunk in appetite and
selfish isolation into the state of universal self-consciousness.
Force, then, is the external or phenomenal
commencement of states, not their underlying and
essential principle.
</p>

<p>
§ 434. This status, in the first place, implies <emph>common</emph>
wants and common concern for their satisfaction,&mdash;for
the means of mastery, the slave, must likewise
be kept in life. In place of the rude destruction of the
immediate object there ensues acquisition, preservation,
and formation of it, as the instrumentality in which the
two extremes of independence and non-independence are
welded together. The form of universality thus arising
in satisfying the want, creates a <emph>permanent</emph> means and
a provision which takes care for and secures the future.
</p>

<pb n='057'/><anchor id='Pg057'/>

<p>
§ 435. But secondly, when we look to the distinction
of the two, the master beholds in the slave and his servitude
the supremacy of his <emph>single</emph> self-hood, and that by
the suppression of immediate self-hood, a suppression,
however, which falls on another. This other, the
slave, however, in the service of the master, works off
his individualist self-will, overcomes the inner immediacy
of appetite, and in this divestment of self and in
<q>the fear of his lord</q> makes <q>the beginning of wisdom</q>&mdash;the
passage to universal self-consciousness.
</p>

</div>

<div>
<head>(γ) Universal Self-consciousness.</head>

<p>
§ 436. Universal self-consciousness is the affirmative
awareness of self in an other self: each self as a free
individuality has his own <q>absolute</q> independence, yet
in virtue of the negation of its immediacy or appetite
without distinguishing itself from that other. Each is
thus universal self-conscious and objective; each has
<q>real</q> universality in the shape of reciprocity, so far as
each knows itself recognised in the other freeman, and
is aware of this in so far as it recognises the other and
knows him to be free.
</p>

<p>
This universal re-appearance of self-consciousness&mdash;the
notion which is aware of itself in its objectivity as
a subjectivity identical with itself and for that reason
universal&mdash;is the form of consciousness which lies at
the root of all true mental or spiritual life&mdash;in family,
fatherland, state, and of all virtues, love, friendship,
valour, honour, fame. But this appearance of the
underlying essence may be severed from that essential,
and be maintained apart in worthless honour, idle
fame, &amp;c.
</p>

<p>
<anchor id='Section_437'/>
§ 437. This unity of consciousness and self-consciousness
implies in the first instance the individuals mutually
<pb n='058'/><anchor id='Pg058'/>
throwing light upon each other. But the difference
between those who are thus identified is mere vague
diversity&mdash;or rather it is a difference which is none.
Hence its truth is the fully and really existent universality
and objectivity of self-consciousness,&mdash;which is
<emph>Reason</emph>.
</p>

<p>
Reason, as the <emph>Idea</emph> (§ 213) as it here appears, is to be
taken as meaning that the distinction between notion
and reality which it unifies has the special aspect of
a distinction between the self-concentrated notion or
consciousness, and the object subsisting external and
opposed to it.
</p>

</div>

</div>

<div>
<head>(c) Reason<note place='foot'><foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Die Vernunft.</foreign></note>.</head>

<p>
§ 438. The essential and actual truth which reason is,
lies in the simple identity of the subjectivity of the
notion, with its objectivity and universality. The
universality of reason, therefore, whilst it signifies that
the object, which was only given in consciousness <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>quâ</foreign>
consciousness, is now itself universal, permeating and
encompassing the ego, also signifies that the pure ego
is the pure form which overlaps the object, and encompasses
it without it.
</p>

<p>
§ 439. Self-consciousness, thus certified that its
determinations are no less objective, or determinations
of the very being of things, than they are its own
thoughts, is Reason, which as such an identity is not
only the absolute <emph>substance</emph>, but the <emph>truth</emph> that knows it.
For truth here has, as its peculiar mode and immanent
form, the self-centred pure notion, ego, the certitude of
self as infinite universality. Truth, aware of what it is,
is mind (spirit).

<head>Sub-Section C. Psychology. Mind<note place='foot'><foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Der Geist.</foreign></note>.</head>

<p>
§ 440. Mind has defined itself as the truth of soul and
consciousness,&mdash;the former a simple immediate totality,
the latter now an infinite form which is not, like consciousness,
restricted by that content, and does not
stand in mere correlation to it as to its object, but is
an awareness of this substantial totality, neither subjective
nor objective. Mind, therefore, starts only
from its own being and is in correlation only with its
own features.
</p>

<p>
Psychology accordingly studies the faculties or
general modes of mental activity <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>quâ</foreign> mental&mdash;mental
vision, ideation, remembering, &amp;c., desires, &amp;c.&mdash;apart
both from the content, which on the phenomenal side
is found in empirical ideation, in thinking also and in
desire and will, and from the two forms in which these
modes exist, viz. in the soul as a physical mode, and in
consciousness itself as a separately existent object of
that consciousness. This, however, is not an arbitrary
abstraction by the psychologist. Mind is just this elevation
above nature and physical modes, and above the
<pb n='060'/><anchor id='Pg060'/>
complication with an external object&mdash;in one word, above
the material, as its concept has just shown. All it has
now to do is to realise this notion of its freedom, and get
rid of the <emph>form</emph> of immediacy with which it once more
begins. The content which is elevated to intuitions is
<emph>its</emph> sensations: it is <emph>its</emph> intuitions also which are transmuted
into representations, and its representations which
are transmuted again into thoughts, &amp;c.
</p>

<p>
§ 441. The soul is finite, so far as its features are
immediate or con-natural. Consciousness is finite, in so
far as it has an object. Mind is finite, in so far as,
though it no longer has an object, it has a mode in its
knowledge; i.e., it is finite by means of its immediacy,
or, what is the same thing, by being subjective or only
a notion. And it is a matter of no consequence, which
is defined as its notion, and which as the reality of
that notion. Say that its notion is the utterly infinite
objective reason, then its reality is knowledge or <emph>intelligence</emph>:
say that knowledge is its notion, then its reality
is that reason, and the realisation of knowledge consists
in appropriating reason. Hence the finitude of mind is
to be placed in the (temporary) failure of knowledge to
get hold of the full reality of its reason, or, equally, in
the (temporary) failure of reason to attain full manifestation
in knowledge. Reason at the same time is
only infinite so far as it is <q>absolute</q> freedom; so far,
that is, as presupposing itself for its knowledge to work
upon, it thereby reduces itself to finitude, and appears
as everlasting movement of superseding this immediacy,
of comprehending itself, and being a rational knowledge.
</p>

<p>
§ 442. The progress of mind is <emph>development</emph>, in so far
as its existent phase, viz. knowledge, involves as its
intrinsic purpose and burden that utter and complete
autonomy which is rationality; in which case the action
of translating this purpose into reality is strictly only
<pb n='061'/><anchor id='Pg061'/>
a nominal passage over into manifestation, and is even
there a return into itself. So far as knowledge which
has not shaken off its original quality of <emph>mere</emph> knowledge
is only abstract or formal, the goal of mind is to give
it objective fulfilment, and thus at the same time produce
its freedom.
</p>

<p>
The development here meant is not that of the
individual (which has a certain <emph>anthropological</emph> character),
where faculties and forces are regarded as successively
emerging and presenting themselves in external
existence&mdash;a series of steps, on the ascertainment on
which there was for a long time great stress laid (by
the system of Condillac), as if a conjectural natural
emergence could exhibit the origin of these faculties
and <emph>explain</emph> them. In Condillac's method there is an
unmistakable intention to show how the <emph>several</emph> modes
of mental activity could be made intelligible without
losing sight of mental unity, and to exhibit their necessary
interconnexion. But the categories employed in doing
so are of a wretched sort. Their ruling principle is
that the sensible is taken (and with justice) as the <foreign rend='italic'>prius</foreign>
or the initial basis, but that the later phases that follow
this starting-point present themselves as emerging in
a solely <emph>affirmative</emph> manner, and the negative aspect
of mental activity, by which this material is transmuted
into mind and destroyed <emph>as</emph> a sensible, is misconceived
and overlooked. As the theory of Condillac states it,
the sensible is not merely the empirical first, but is left
as if it were the true and essential foundation.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, if the activities of mind are treated as mere
manifestations, forces, perhaps in terms stating their
utility or suitability for some other interest of head or
heart, there is no indication of the true final aim of the
whole business. That can only be the intelligible unity
of mind, and its activity can only have itself as aim; i.e.
<pb n='062'/><anchor id='Pg062'/>
its aim can only be to get rid of the form of immediacy
or subjectivity, to reach and get hold of itself, and to
liberate itself to itself. In this way the so-called
faculties of mind as thus distinguished are only to be
treated as steps of this liberation. And this is the
only <emph>rational</emph> mode of studying the mind and its various
activities.
</p>

<p>
§ 443. As consciousness has for its object the stage
which preceded it, viz. the natural soul (§ <ref target='Section_413'>413</ref>), so mind
has or rather makes consciousness its object: i.e.
whereas consciousness is only the virtual identity of the
ego with its other (§ <ref target='Section_415'>415</ref>), the mind realises that identity
as the concrete unity which it and it only knows. Its
productions are governed by the principle of all reason
that the contents are at once potentially existent, and
are the mind's own, in freedom. Thus, if we consider
the initial aspect of mind, that aspect is twofold&mdash;as
<emph>being</emph> and as <emph>its own</emph>: by the one, the mind finds in
itself something which <emph>is</emph>, by the other it affirms it to
be only <emph>its own</emph>. The way of mind is therefore
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>a</hi>) to be theoretical: it has to do with the rational
as its immediate affection which it must render its own:
or it has to free knowledge from its pre-supposedness
and therefore from its abstractness, and make the
affection subjective. When the affection has been
rendered its own, and the knowledge consequently
characterised as free intelligence, i.e. as having its full
and free characterisation in itself, it is
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>b</hi>) Will: <emph>practical</emph> mind, which in the first place is
likewise formal&mdash;i.e. its content is at first <emph>only</emph> its own,
and is immediately willed; and it proceeds next to
liberate its volition from its subjectivity, which is the
one-sided form of its contents, so that it
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>c</hi>) confronts itself as free mind and thus gets rid of
both its defects of one-sidedness.
</p>

<pb n='063'/><anchor id='Pg063'/>

<p>
§ 444. The theoretical as well as the practical mind
still fall under the general range of Mind Subjective.
They are not to be distinguished as active and passive.
Subjective mind is productive: but it is a merely
nominal productivity. Inwards, the theoretical mind
produces only its <q>ideal</q> world, and gains abstract
autonomy within; while the practical, while it has to do
with autonomous products, with a material which is its
own, has a material which is only nominally such, and
therefore a restricted content, for which it gains the
form of universality. Outwards, the subjective mind
(which as a unity of soul and consciousness, is thus
also a reality,&mdash;a reality at once anthropological and
conformable to consciousness) has for its products, in
the theoretical range, the <emph>word</emph>, and in the practical
(not yet deed and action, but) <emph>enjoyment</emph>.
</p>

<p>
Psychology, like logic, is one of those sciences which
in modern times have yet derived least profit from the
more general mental culture and the deeper conception
of reason. It is still extremely ill off. The turn
which the Kantian philosophy has taken has given it
greater importance: it has, and that in its empirical
condition, been claimed as the basis of metaphysics,
which is to consist of nothing but the empirical
apprehension and the analysis of the facts of human
consciousness, merely as facts, just as they are given.
This position of psychology, mixing it up with forms
belonging to the range of consciousness and with
anthropology, has led to no improvement in its own
condition: but it has had the further effect that, both for
the mind as such, and for metaphysics and philosophy
generally, all attempts have been abandoned to ascertain
the necessity of essential and actual reality, to get at
the notion and the truth.

§ 445. Intelligence<note place='foot'><foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Die Intelligenz.</foreign></note> <emph>finds</emph> itself determined: this is its
apparent aspect from which in its immediacy it starts.
But as knowledge, intelligence consists in treating
what is found as its own. Its activity has to do with
the empty form&mdash;the pretence of <emph>finding</emph> reason: and its
aim is to realise its concept or to be reason actual,
along with which the content is realised as rational.
This activity is <emph>cognition</emph>. The nominal knowledge,
which is only certitude, elevates itself, as reason is
concrete, to definite and conceptual knowledge. The
course of this elevation is itself rational, and consists in
a necessary passage (governed by the concept) of one
grade or term of intelligent activity (a so-called faculty
of mind) into another. The refutation which such cognition
gives of the semblance that the rational is <emph>found</emph>,
starts from the certitude or the faith of intelligence in its
capability of rational knowledge, and in the possibility
of being able to appropriate the reason, which it and the
content virtually is.
</p>

<p>
The distinction of Intelligence from Will is often
incorrectly taken to mean that each has a fixed and
separate existence of its own, as if volition could be
without intelligence, or the activity of intelligence could
be without will. The possibility of a culture of the
intellect which leaves the heart untouched, as it is said,
and of the heart without the intellect&mdash;of hearts which
in one-sided way want intellect, and heartless intellects&mdash;only
proves at most that bad and radically untrue
existences occur. But it is not philosophy which should
take such untruths of existence and of mere imagining
for truth&mdash;take the worthless for the essential nature.
A host of other phrases used of intelligence, e.g. that it
<pb n='065'/><anchor id='Pg065'/>
receives and accepts impressions from outside, that
ideas arise through the causal operations of external
things upon it, &amp;c., belong to a point of view utterly
alien to the mental level or to the position of philosophic
study.
</p>

<p>
A favourite reflectional form is that of powers and
faculties of soul, intelligence, or mind. Faculty, like
power or force, is the fixed quality of any object of
thought, conceived as reflected into self. Force (§ 136)
is no doubt the infinity of form&mdash;of the inward and the
outward: but its essential finitude involves the indifference
of content to form (ib. note). In this lies
the want of organic unity which by this reflectional
form, treating mind as a <q>lot</q> of forces, is brought into
mind, as it is by the same method brought into nature.
Any aspect which can be distinguished in mental action
is stereotyped as an independent entity, and the mind
thus made a skeleton-like mechanical collection. It
makes absolutely no difference if we substitute the
expression <q>activities</q> for powers and faculties. Isolate
the activities and you similarly make the mind a mere
aggregate, and treat their essential correlation as an
external incident.
</p>

<p>
The action of intelligence as theoretical mind has
been called <emph>cognition</emph> (knowledge). Yet this does not
mean intelligence <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>inter alia</foreign> knows,&mdash;besides which
it also intuites, conceives, remembers, imagines, &amp;c.
To take up such a position is in the first instance part
and parcel of that isolating of mental activity just
censured; but it is also in addition connected with the
great question of modern times, as to whether true
knowledge or the knowledge of truth is possible,&mdash;which,
if answered in the negative, must lead to abandoning
the effort. The numerous aspects and reasons and
modes of phrase with which external reflection swells
<pb n='066'/><anchor id='Pg066'/>
the bulk of this question are cleared up in their place:
the more external the attitude of understanding in the
question, the more diffuse it makes a simple object.
At the present place the simple concept of cognition is
what confronts the quite general assumption taken up
by the question, viz. the assumption that the possibility
of true knowledge in general is in dispute, and the
assumption that it is possible for us at our will either to
prosecute or to abandon cognition. The concept or
possibility of cognition has come out as intelligence
itself, as the certitude of reason: the act of cognition
itself is therefore the actuality of intelligence. It
follows from this that it is absurd to speak of intelligence
and yet at the same time of the possibility or choice of
knowing or not. But cognition is genuine, just so far as
it realises itself, or makes the concept its own. This
nominal description has its concrete meaning exactly
where cognition has it. The stages of its realising
activity are intuition, conception, memory, &amp;c.: these
activities have no other immanent meaning: their aim
is solely the concept of cognition (§ <ref target='Section_445'>445</ref> note). If they
are isolated, however, then an impression is implied
that they are useful for something else than cognition,
or that they severally procure a cognitive satisfaction
of their own; and that leads to a glorification of the
delights of intuition, remembrance, imagination. It
is true that even as isolated (i.e. as non-intelligent),
intuition, imagination, &amp;c. can afford a certain satisfaction:
what physical nature succeeds in doing by its
fundamental quality&mdash;its out-of-selfness,&mdash;exhibiting
the elements or factors of immanent reason external to
each other,&mdash;that the intelligence can do by voluntary act,
but the same result may happen where the intelligence
is itself only natural and untrained. But the <emph>true satisfaction</emph>,
it is admitted, is only afforded by an intuition
<pb n='067'/><anchor id='Pg067'/>
permeated by intellect and mind, by rational conception,
by products of imagination which are permeated by
reason and exhibit ideas&mdash;in a word, by <emph>cognitive</emph>
intuition, cognitive conception, &amp;c. The truth ascribed
to such satisfaction lies in this, that intuition, conception,
&amp;c. are not isolated, and exist only as <q>moments</q> in
the totality of cognition itself.

<p>
§ 446. The mind which as soul is physically conditioned,&mdash;which
as consciousness stands to this condition
on the same terms as to an outward object,&mdash;but
which as intelligence <emph>finds itself</emph> so characterised&mdash;is
(1) an inarticulate embryonic life, in which it is to itself
as it were palpable and has the whole <emph>material</emph> of its
knowledge. In consequence of the immediacy in
which it is thus originally, it is in this stage only as
an individual and possesses a vulgar subjectivity. It
thus appears as mind in the guise of <emph>feeling</emph>.
</p>

<p>
If feeling formerly turned up (§ <ref target='Section_399'>399</ref>) as a mode of
the <emph>soul's</emph> existence, the finding of it or its immediacy
was in that case essentially to be conceived as a congenital
or corporeal condition; whereas at present it is
only to be taken abstractly in the general sense of
immediacy.
</p>

<p>
§ 447. The characteristic form of feeling is that though
it is a mode of some <q>affection,</q> this mode is simple.
Hence feeling, even should its import be most sterling
and true, has the form of casual particularity,&mdash;not to
mention that its import may also be the most scanty
and most untrue.
</p>

<p>
It is commonly enough assumed that mind has in
its feeling the material of its ideas, but the statement
<pb n='068'/><anchor id='Pg068'/>
is more usually understood in a sense the opposite
of that which it has here. In contrast with the simplicity
of feeling it is usual rather to assume that the
primary mental phase is judgment generally, or the
distinction of consciousness into subject and object;
and the special quality of sensation is derived from an
independent <emph>object</emph>, external or internal. With us, in the
truth of mind, the mere consciousness point of view, as
opposed to true mental <q>idealism,</q> is swallowed up, and
the matter of feeling has rather been supposed already
as <emph>immanent</emph> in the mind.&mdash;It is commonly taken for
granted that as regards content there is more in feeling
than in thought: this being specially affirmed of moral
and religious feelings. Now the material, which the
mind as it feels is to itself, is <emph>here</emph> the result and the
mature result of a fully organised reason: hence under
the head of feeling is comprised all rational and indeed
all spiritual content whatever. But the form of selfish
singleness to which feeling reduces the mind is the
lowest and worst vehicle it can have&mdash;one in which it is
not found as a free and infinitely universal principle, but
rather as subjective and private, in content and value
entirely contingent. Trained and sterling feeling is the
feeling of an educated mind which has acquired the
consciousness of the true differences of things, of
their essential relationships and real characters; and it
is with such a mind that this rectified material enters
into its feeling and receives this form. Feeling is the
immediate, as it were the closest, contact in which the
thinking subject can stand to a given content. Against
that content the subject re-acts first of all with its particular
self-feeling, which though it <emph>may</emph> be of more
sterling value and of wider range than a onesided
intellectual standpoint, may just as likely be narrow
and poor; and in any case is the form of the particular
<pb n='069'/><anchor id='Pg069'/>
and subjective. If a man on any topic appeals not
to the nature and notion of the thing, or at least to
reasons&mdash;to the generalities of common sense&mdash;but to
his feeling, the only thing to do is to let him alone,
because by his behaviour he refuses to have any lot or
part in common rationality, and shuts himself up in his
own isolated subjectivity&mdash;his private and particular
self.
</p>

<p>
§ 448. (2) As this immediate finding is broken up into
elements, we have the one factor in <emph>Attention</emph>&mdash;the
abstract <emph>identical</emph> direction of mind (in feeling, as also in
all other more advanced developments of it)&mdash;an active
self-collection&mdash;the factor of fixing it as our own, but
with an as yet only nominal autonomy of intelligence.
Apart from such attention there is nothing for the mind.
The other factor is to invest the special quality of feeling,
as contrasted with this inwardness of mind, with the character
of something existent, but as a <emph>negative</emph> or as the
abstract otherness of itself. Intelligence thus defines
the content of sensation as something that is out of
itself, projects it into time and space, which are the
forms in which it is intuitive. To the view of consciousness
the material is only an object of consciousness,
a relative other: from mind it receives the rational
characteristic of being <emph>its very other</emph> (§§ 147, 254).
</p>

<p>
§ 449. (3) When intelligence reaches a concrete unity
of the two factors, that is to say, when it is at once self-collected
in this externally existing material, and yet in
this self-collectedness sunk in the out-of-selfness, it is
<emph>Intuition</emph> or Mental Vision.
</p>

<p>
<anchor id='Section_450'/>
§ 450. At and towards this its own out-of-selfness,
intelligence no less essentially directs its attention. In
this its immediacy it is an awaking to itself, a recollection
of itself. Thus intuition becomes a concretion
of the material with the intelligence, which makes it its
<pb n='070'/><anchor id='Pg070'/>
own, so that it no longer needs this immediacy, no
longer needs to find the content.

<p>
<anchor id='Section_451'/>
§ 451. Representation is this recollected or inwardised
intuition, and as such is the middle between that stage
of intelligence where it finds itself immediately subject
to modification and that where intelligence is in its freedom,
or, as thought. The representation is the property
of intelligence; with a preponderating subjectivity, however,
as its right of property is still conditioned by contrast
with the immediacy, and the representation cannot
as it stands be said to <emph>be</emph>. The path of intelligence in
representations is to render the immediacy inward, to
invest itself with intuitive action in itself, and at the
same time to get rid of the subjectivity of the inwardness,
and inwardly divest itself of it; so as to be in itself
in an externality of its own. But as representation
begins from intuition and the ready-found material of
intuition, the intuitional contrast still continues to affect
its activity, and makes its concrete products still
<q>syntheses,</q> which do not grow to the concrete immanence
of the notion till they reach the stage of
thought.

<head>(αα) Recollection<note place='foot'><foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Die Erinnerung.</foreign></note>.</head>

<p>
§ 452. Intelligence, as it at first recollects the intuition,
places the content of feeling in its own inwardness&mdash;in
a space and a time of its own. In this way that content
is (1) an <emph>image</emph> or picture, liberated from its original
immediacy and abstract singleness amongst other things,
and received into the universality of the ego. The
<pb n='071'/><anchor id='Pg071'/>
image loses the full complement of features proper to
intuition, and is arbitrary or contingent, isolated, we
may say, from the external place, time, and immediate
context in which the intuition stood.
</p>

<p>
<anchor id='Section_453'/>
§ 453. (2) The image is of itself transient, and intelligence
itself is as attention its time and also its place, its when
and where. But intelligence is not only consciousness
and actual existence, but <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>quâ</foreign> intelligence is the subject
and the potentiality of its own specialisations. The
image when thus kept in mind is no longer existent,
but stored up out of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
To grasp intelligence as this night-like mine or pit
in which is stored a world of infinitely many images
and representations, yet without being in consciousness,
is from the one point of view the universal postulate
which bids us treat the notion as concrete, in the way
we treat e.g. the germ as affirmatively containing, in
virtual possibility, all the qualities that come into
existence in the subsequent development of the tree.
Inability to grasp a universal like this, which, though
intrinsically concrete, still continues <emph>simple</emph>, is what has
led people to talk about special fibres and areas as
receptacles of particular ideas. It was felt that what
was diverse should in the nature of things have a local
habitation peculiar to itself. But whereas the reversion
of the germ from its existing specialisations to its simplicity
in a purely potential existence takes place only
in another germ,&mdash;the germ of the fruit; intelligence <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>quâ</foreign>
intelligence shows the potential coming to free existence
in its development, and yet at the same time
collecting itself in its inwardness. Hence from the
other point of view intelligence is to be conceived as
this sub-conscious mine, i.e. as the <emph>existent</emph> universal
in which the different has not yet been realised in its
separations. And it is indeed this potentiality which
<pb n='072'/><anchor id='Pg072'/>
is the first form of universality offered in mental representation.
</p>

<p>
<anchor id='Section_454'/>
§ 454. (3) An image thus abstractly treasured up needs,
if it is to exist, an actual intuition: and what is strictly
called Remembrance is the reference of the image to
an intuition,&mdash;and that as a subsumption of the immediate
single intuition (impression) under what is in
point of form universal, under the representation (idea)
with the same content. Thus intelligence recognises
the specific sensation and the intuition of it as what
is already its own,&mdash;in them it is still within itself: at
the same time it is aware that what is only its (primarily)
internal image is also an immediate object of intuition,
by which it is authenticated. The image, which
in the mine of intelligence was only its <emph>property</emph>, now
that it has been endued with externality, comes actually
into its <emph>possession</emph>. And so the image is at once rendered
distinguishable from the intuition and separable
from the blank night in which it was originally submerged.
Intelligence is thus the force which can give
forth its property, and dispense with external intuition
for its existence in it. This <q>synthesis</q> of the internal
image with the recollected existence is <emph>representation</emph>
proper: by this synthesis the internal now has the
qualification of being able to be presented before intelligence
and to have its existence in it.

<head>(ββ) Imagination<note place='foot'><foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Die Einbildungskraft.</foreign></note>.</head>

<p>
<anchor id='Section_455'/>
§ 455. (1) The intelligence which is active in this
possession is the <emph>reproductive imagination</emph>, where the
images issue from the inward world belonging to the
ego, which is now the power over them. The images
are in the first instance referred to this external, immediate
<pb n='073'/><anchor id='Pg073'/>
time and space which is treasured up along with
them. But it is solely in the conscious subject, where
it is treasured up, that the image has the individuality
in which the features composing it are conjoined:
whereas their original concretion, i.e. at first only in
space and time, as a <emph>unit</emph> of intuition, has been broken
up. The content reproduced, belonging as it does to
the self-identical unity of intelligence, and an out-put
from its universal mine, has a general idea (representation)
to supply the link of association for the images
which according to circumstances are more abstract or
more concrete ideas.
</p>

<p>
The so-called <emph>laws of the association of ideas</emph> were
objects of great interest, especially during that outburst
of empirical psychology which was contemporaneous
with the decline of philosophy. In the first place, it is
not <emph>Ideas</emph> (properly so called) which are associated.
Secondly, these modes of relation are not <emph>laws</emph>, just for
the reason that there are so many laws about the
same thing, as to suggest a caprice and a contingency
opposed to the very nature of law. It is a matter of
chance whether the link of association is something
pictorial, or an intellectual category, such as likeness
and contrast, reason and consequence. The train of
images and representations suggested by association
is the sport of vacant-minded ideation, where, though
intelligence shows itself by a certain formal universality,
the matter is entirely pictorial.&mdash;Image and idea,
if we leave out of account the more precise definition
of those forms given above, present also a distinction
in content. The former is the more consciously-concrete
idea, whereas the idea (representation), whatever be its
content (from image, notion, or idea), has always the
peculiarity, though belonging to intelligence, of being
in respect of its content given and immediate. It is still
<pb n='074'/><anchor id='Pg074'/>
true of this idea or representation, as of all intelligence,
that it finds its material, as a matter of fact, to <emph>be</emph> so and
so; and the universality which the aforesaid material
receives by ideation is still abstract. Mental representation
is the mean in the syllogism of the elevation of
intelligence, the link between the two significations of
self-relatedness&mdash;viz. <emph>being</emph> and <emph>universality</emph>, which in
consciousness receive the title of object and subject.
Intelligence complements what is merely found by the
attribution of universality, and the internal and its
own by the attribution of being, but a being of its own
institution. (On the distinction of representations and
thoughts, see Introd. to the Logic, § 20 note.)
</p>

<p>
Abstraction, which occurs in the ideational activity by
which general ideas are produced (and ideas <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>quâ</foreign> ideas
virtually have the form of generality), is frequently
explained as the incidence of many similar images one
upon another and is supposed to be thus made intelligible.
If this super-imposing is to be no mere accident
and without principle, a force of attraction in like images
must be assumed, or something of the sort, which at the
same time would have the negative power of rubbing
off the dissimilar elements against each other. This
force is really intelligence itself,&mdash;the self-identical ego
which by its internalising recollection gives the images
<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>ipso facto</foreign> generality, and subsumes the single intuition
under the already internalised image (§ <ref target='Section_453'>453</ref>).
</p>

<p>
§ 456. Thus even the association of ideas is to be
treated as a subsumption of the individual under the
universal, which forms their connecting link. But here
intelligence is more than merely a general form: its
inwardness is an internally definite, concrete subjectivity
with a substance and value of its own, derived from
some interest, some latent concept or Ideal principle, so
far as we may by anticipation speak of such. Intelligence
<pb n='075'/><anchor id='Pg075'/>
is the power which wields the stores of images
and ideas belonging to it, and which thus (2) freely
combines and subsumes these stores in obedience to its
peculiar tenor. Such is creative imagination<note place='foot'><foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Phantasie.</foreign></note>&mdash;symbolic,
allegoric, or poetical imagination&mdash;where the
intelligence gets a definite embodiment in this store
of ideas and informs them with its general tone.
These more or less concrete, individualised creations
are still <q>syntheses</q>: for the material, in which the subjective
principles and ideas get a mentally pictorial
existence, is derived from the data of intuition.
</p>

<p>
§ 457. In creative imagination intelligence has been so
far perfected as to need no helps for intuition. Its self-sprung
ideas have pictorial existence. This pictorial
creation of its intuitive spontaneity is subjective&mdash;still
lacks the side of existence. But as the creation
unites the internal idea with the vehicle of materialisation,
intelligence has therein <emph>implicitly</emph> returned both
to identical self-relation and to immediacy. As reason,
its first start was to appropriate the immediate datum
in itself (§§ <ref target='Section_445'>445</ref>, <ref target='Section_455'>455</ref>), i.e. to universalise it; and now
its action as reason (§ <ref target='Section_458'>458</ref>) is from the present point
directed towards giving the character of an existent to
what in it has been perfected to concrete auto-intuition.
In other words, it aims at making itself <emph>be</emph> and be a fact.
Acting on this view, it is self-uttering, intuition-producing:
the imagination which creates signs.
</p>

<p>
Productive imagination is the centre in which the
universal and being, one's own and what is picked up,
internal and external, are completely welded into one.
The preceding <q>syntheses</q> of intuition, recollection, &amp;c.,
are unifications of the same factors, but they are <q>syntheses</q>;
it is not till creative imagination that intelligence
ceases to be the vague mine and the universal,
<pb n='076'/><anchor id='Pg076'/>
and becomes an individuality, a concrete subjectivity, in
which the self-reference is defined both to being and to
universality. The creations of imagination are on all
hands recognised as such combinations of the mind's
own and inward with the matter of intuition; what
further and more definite aspects they have is a matter
for other departments. For the present this internal
studio of intelligence is only to be looked at in these
abstract aspects.&mdash;Imagination, when regarded as the
agency of this unification, is reason, but only a nominal
reason, because the matter or theme it embodies is to
imagination <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>quâ</foreign> imagination a matter of indifference;
whilst reason <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>quâ</foreign> reason also insists upon the <emph>truth</emph> of
its content.
</p>

<p>
Another point calling for special notice is that, when
imagination elevates the internal meaning to an image
and intuition, and this is expressed by saying that it
gives the former the character of an <emph>existent</emph>, the phrase
must not seem surprising that intelligence makes itself
<emph>be</emph> as a <emph>thing</emph>; for its ideal import is itself, and so is
the aspect which it imposes upon it. The image
produced by imagination of an object is a bare mental
or subjective intuition: in the sign or symbol it adds
intuitability proper; and in mechanical memory it
completes, so far as it is concerned, this form of <emph>being</emph>.
</p>

<p>
<anchor id='Section_458'/>
§ 458. In this unity (initiated by intelligence) of an
independent representation with an intuition, the matter
of the latter is, in the first instance, something accepted,
somewhat immediate or given (e.g. the colour of the
cockade, &amp;c.). But in the fusion of the two elements,
the intuition does not count positively or as representing
itself, but as representative of something else. It is an
image, which has received as its soul and meaning an
independent mental representation. This intuition is
the <emph>Sign</emph>.
</p>

<pb n='077'/><anchor id='Pg077'/>

<p>
The sign is some immediate intuition, representing
a totally different import from what naturally belongs to
it; it is the pyramid into which a foreign soul has been
conveyed, and where it is conserved. The <emph>sign</emph> is
different from the <emph>symbol</emph>: for in the symbol the original
characters (in essence and conception) of the visible
object are more or less identical with the import which
it bears as symbol; whereas in the sign, strictly
so-called, the natural attributes of the intuition, and the
connotation of which it is a sign, have nothing to do
with each other. Intelligence therefore gives proof
of wider choice and ampler authority in the use of
intuitions when it treats them as designatory (significative)
rather than as symbolical.
</p>

<p>
In logic and psychology, signs and language are
usually foisted in somewhere as an appendix, without
any trouble being taken to display their necessity and
systematic place in the economy of intelligence. The
right place for the sign is that just given: where intelligence&mdash;which
as intuiting generates the form of time
and space, but is apparently recipient of sensible
matter, out of which it forms ideas&mdash;now gives its own
original ideas a definite existence from itself, treating
the intuition (or time and space as filled full) as its own
property, deleting the connotation which properly and
naturally belongs to it, and conferring on it an other
connotation as its soul and import. This sign-creating
activity may be distinctively named <q>productive</q>
Memory (the primarily abstract <q>Mnemosyne</q>); since
memory, which in ordinary life is often used as interchangeable
and synonymous with remembrance (recollection),
and even with conception and imagination, has
always to do with signs only.
</p>

<p>
§ 459. The intuition&mdash;in its natural phase a something
given and given in space&mdash;acquires, when employed as
<pb n='078'/><anchor id='Pg078'/>
a sign, the peculiar characteristic of existing only as
superseded and sublimated. Such is the negativity of
intelligence; and thus the truer phase of the intuition
used as a sign is existence in <emph>time</emph> (but its existence
vanishes in the moment of being), and if we consider
the rest of its external psychical quality, its <emph>institution</emph>
by intelligence, but an institution growing out of its
(anthropological) own naturalness. This institution of
the natural is the vocal note, where the inward idea
manifests itself in adequate utterance. The vocal note
which receives further articulation to express specific
ideas&mdash;speech and, its system, language&mdash;gives to
sensations, intuitions, conceptions, a second and higher
existence than they naturally possess,&mdash;invests them
with the right of existence in the ideational realm.
</p>

<p>
Language here comes under discussion only in the
special aspect of a product of intelligence for manifesting
its ideas in an external medium. If language had
to be treated in its concrete nature, it would be necessary
for its vocabulary or material part to recall the
anthropological or psycho-physiological point of view
(§ <ref target='Section_401'>401</ref>), and for the grammar or formal portion to anticipate
the standpoint of analytic understanding. With
regard to the elementary <emph>material</emph> of language, while on
one hand the theory of mere accident has disappeared, on
the other the principle of imitation has been restricted
to the slight range it actually covers&mdash;that of vocal
objects. Yet one may still hear the German language
praised for its wealth&mdash;that wealth consisting in its
special expression for special sounds&mdash;<foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Rauschen</foreign>, <foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Sausen</foreign>,
<foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Knarren</foreign>, &amp;c.;&mdash;there have been collected more than
a hundred such words, perhaps: the humour of the
moment creates fresh ones when it pleases. Such
superabundance in the realm of sense and of triviality
contributes nothing to form the real wealth of a cultivated
<pb n='079'/><anchor id='Pg079'/>
language. The strictly raw material of language
itself depends more upon an inward symbolism than
a symbolism referring to external objects; it depends,
i.e. on anthropological articulation, as it were the
posture in the corporeal act of oral utterance. For
each vowel and consonant accordingly, as well as for
their more abstract elements (the posture of lips, palate,
tongue in each) and for their combinations, people have
tried to find the appropriate signification. But these
dull sub-conscious beginnings are deprived of their
original importance and prominence by new influences,
it may be by external agencies or by the needs of civilisation.
Having been originally sensuous intuitions,
they are reduced to signs, and thus have only traces
left of their original meaning, if it be not altogether
extinguished. As to the <emph>formal</emph> element, again, it is
the work of analytic intellect which informs language
with its categories: it is this logical instinct which gives
rise to grammar. The study of languages still in their
original state, which we have first really begun to make
acquaintance with in modern times, has shown on this
point that they contain a very elaborate grammar and
express distinctions which are lost or have been largely
obliterated in the languages of more civilised nations.
It seems as if the language of the most civilised nations
has the most imperfect grammar, and that the same
language has a more perfect grammar when the nation
is in a more uncivilised state than when it reaches
a higher civilisation. (Cf. W. von Humboldt's <hi rend='italic'>Essay
on the Dual</hi>.)
</p>

<p>
In speaking of vocal (which is the original) language,
we may touch, only in passing, upon written language,&mdash;a
further development in the particular sphere of
language which borrows the help of an externally
practical activity. It is from the province of immediate
<pb n='080'/><anchor id='Pg080'/>
spatial intuition to which written language proceeds
that it takes and produces the signs (§ <ref target='Section_454'>454</ref>). In particular,
hieroglyphics uses spatial figures to designate
<emph>ideas</emph>; alphabetical writing, on the other hand, uses
them to designate vocal notes which are already signs.
Alphabetical writing thus consists of signs of signs,&mdash;the
words or concrete signs of vocal language being
analysed into their simple elements, which severally
receive designation.&mdash;Leibnitz's practical mind misled
him to exaggerate the advantages which a complete
written language, formed on the hieroglyphic method
(and hieroglyphics are used even where there is alphabetic
writing, as in our signs for the numbers, the planets,
the chemical elements, &amp;c.), would have as a universal
language for the intercourse of nations and especially
of scholars. But we may be sure that it was rather the
intercourse of nations (as was probably the case in
Phoenicia, and still takes place in Canton&mdash;see <hi rend='italic'>Macartney's
Travels</hi> by Staunton) which occasioned the need
of alphabetical writing and led to its formation. At
any rate a comprehensive hieroglyphic language for
ever completed is impracticable. Sensible objects no
doubt admit of permanent signs; but, as regards signs
for mental objects, the progress of thought and the
continual development of logic lead to changes in the
views of their internal relations and thus also of their
nature; and this would involve the rise of a new hieroglyphical
denotation. Even in the case of sense-objects
it happens that their names, i.e. their signs in vocal
language, are frequently changed, as e.g. in chemistry
and mineralogy. Now that it has been forgotten what
names properly are, viz. externalities which of themselves
have no sense, and only get signification as
signs, and now that, instead of names proper, people
ask for terms expressing a sort of definition, which is
<pb n='081'/><anchor id='Pg081'/>
frequently changed capriciously and fortuitously, the
denomination, i.e. the composite name formed of signs
of their generic characters or other supposed characteristic
properties, is altered in accordance with the differences
of view with regard to the genus or other supposed
specific property. It is only a stationary civilisation,
like the Chinese, which admits of the hieroglyphic
language of that nation; and its method of writing
moreover can only be the lot of that small part of
a nation which is in exclusive possession of mental
culture.&mdash;The progress of the vocal language depends
most closely on the habit of alphabetical writing; by
means of which only does vocal language acquire the
precision and purity of its articulation. The imperfection
of the Chinese vocal language is notorious:
numbers of its words possess several utterly different
meanings, as many as ten and twenty, so that, in speaking,
the distinction is made perceptible merely by accent
and intensity, by speaking low and soft or crying out.
The European, learning to speak Chinese, falls into the
most ridiculous blunders before he has mastered these
absurd refinements of accentuation. Perfection here
consists in the opposite of that <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>parler sans accent</foreign> which
in Europe is justly required of an educated speaker.
The hieroglyphic mode of writing keeps the Chinese
vocal language from reaching that objective precision
which is gained in articulation by alphabetic writing.
</p>

<p>
Alphabetic writing is on all accounts the more
intelligent: in it the <emph>word</emph>&mdash;the mode, peculiar to the
intellect, of uttering its ideas most worthily&mdash;is brought
to consciousness and made an object of reflection.
Engaging the attention of intelligence, as it does, it is
analysed; the work of sign-making is reduced to its
few simple elements (the primary postures of articulation)
in which the sense-factor in speech is brought to
<pb n='082'/><anchor id='Pg082'/>
the form of universality, at the same time that in this
elementary phase it acquires complete precision and
purity. Thus alphabetic writing retains at the same
time the advantage of vocal language, that the ideas
have names strictly so called: the name is the simple
sign for the exact idea, i.e. the simple plain idea, not
decomposed into its features and compounded out of
them. Hieroglyphics, instead of springing from the
direct analysis of sensible signs, like alphabetic writing,
arise from an antecedent analysis of ideas. Thus
a theory readily arises that all ideas may be reduced to
their elements, or simple logical terms, so that from the
elementary signs chosen to express these (as, in the case
of the Chinese <foreign rend='italic'>Koua</foreign>, the simple straight stroke, and
the stroke broken into two parts) a hieroglyphic system
would be generated by their composition. This feature
of hieroglyphic&mdash;the analytical designations of ideas&mdash;which
misled Leibnitz to regard it as preferable to
alphabetic writing is rather in antagonism with the
fundamental desideratum of language,&mdash;the name. To
want a name means that for the immediate idea (which,
however ample a connotation it may include, is still for
the mind simple in the name), we require a simple
immediate sign which for its own sake does not suggest
anything, and has for its sole function to signify and
represent sensibly the simple idea as such. It is not
merely the image-loving and image-limited intelligence
that lingers over the simplicity of ideas and redintegrates
them from the more abstract factors into which
they have been analysed: thought too reduces to
the form of a simple thought the concrete connotation
which it <q>resumes</q> and reunites from the mere aggregate
of attributes to which analysis has reduced it. Both
alike require such signs, simple in respect of their
meaning: signs, which though consisting of several
<pb n='083'/><anchor id='Pg083'/>
letters or syllables and even decomposed into such, yet
do not exhibit a combination of several ideas.&mdash;What
has been stated is the principle for settling the value
of these written languages. It also follows that in
hieroglyphics the relations of concrete mental ideas to
one another must necessarily be tangled and perplexed,
and that the analysis of these (and the proximate
results of such analysis must again be analysed) appears
to be possible in the most various and divergent ways.
Every divergence in analysis would give rise to another
formation of the written name; just as in modern times
(as already noted, even in the region of sense) muriatic
acid has undergone several changes of name. A
hieroglyphic written language would require a philosophy
as stationary as is the civilisation of the
Chinese.
</p>

<p>
What has been said shows the inestimable and not
sufficiently appreciated educational value of learning to
read and write an alphabetic character. It leads the
mind from the sensibly concrete image to attend to the
more formal structure of the vocal word and its abstract
elements, and contributes much to give stability and
independence to the inward realm of mental life.
Acquired habit subsequently effaces the peculiarity by
which alphabetic writing appears, in the interest of vision,
as a roundabout way to ideas by means of audibility; it
makes them a sort of hieroglyphic to us, so that in
using them we need not consciously realise them by
means of tones, whereas people unpractised in reading
utter aloud what they read in order to catch its meaning
in the sound. Thus, while (with the faculty which
transformed alphabetic writing into hieroglyphics) the
capacity of abstraction gained by the first practice
remains, hieroglyphic reading is of itself a deaf reading
and a dumb writing. It is true that the audible (which
<pb n='084'/><anchor id='Pg084'/>
is in time) and the visible (which is in space), each have
their own basis, one no less authoritative than the other.
But in the case of alphabetic writing there is only
a <emph>single</emph> basis: the two aspects occupy their rightful
relation to each other: the visible language is related to
the vocal only as a sign, and intelligence expresses itself
immediately and unconditionally by speaking.&mdash;The instrumental
function of the comparatively non-sensuous
element of tone for all ideational work shows itself
further as peculiarly important in memory which forms
the passage from representation to thought.

§ 460. The name, combining the intuition (an intellectual
production) with its signification, is primarily a
single transient product; and conjunction of the idea
(which is inward) with the intuition (which is outward)
is itself outward. The reduction of this outwardness
to inwardness is (verbal) Memory.
</p>

</div>

<div>
<head>(γγ) Memory<note place='foot'><foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Gedächtniß.</foreign></note>.</head>

<p>
§ 461. Under the shape of memory the course of
intelligence passes through the same inwardising
(recollecting) functions, as regards the intuition of the
<emph>word</emph>, as representation in general does in dealing with
the first immediate intuition (§ <ref target='Section_451'>451</ref>). (1) Making its own
the synthesis achieved in the sign, intelligence, by this
inwardising (memorising) elevates the <emph>single</emph> synthesis
to a universal, i.e. permanent, synthesis, in which name
and meaning are for it objectively united, and renders
the intuition (which the name originally is) a representation.
Thus the import (connotation) and sign, being
identified, form one representation: the representation
in its inwardness is rendered concrete and gets
existence for its import: all this being the work of
memory which retains names (retentive Memory).
</p>

<pb n='085'/><anchor id='Pg085'/>

<p>
<anchor id='Section_462'/>
§ 462. The name is thus the thing so far as it exists
and counts in the ideational realm. (2) In the name,
<emph>Reproductive</emph> memory has and recognises the thing, and
with the thing it has the name, apart from intuition and
image. The name, as giving an <emph>existence</emph> to the content
in intelligence, is the externality of intelligence to itself;
and the inwardising or recollection of the name, i.e.
of an intuition of intellectual origin, is at the same time
a self-externalisation to which intelligence reduces itself
on its own ground. The association of the particular
names lies in the meaning of the features sensitive,
representative, or cogitant,&mdash;series of which the intelligence
traverses as it feels, represents, or thinks.
</p>

<p>
Given the name lion, we need neither the actual
vision of the animal, nor its image even: the name
alone, if we <emph>understand</emph> it, is the unimaged simple
representation. We <emph>think</emph> in names.
</p>

<p>
The recent attempts&mdash;already, as they deserved, forgotten&mdash;to
rehabilitate the Mnemonic of the ancients,
consist in transforming names into images, and thus
again deposing memory to the level of imagination.
The place of the power of memory is taken by a
permanent tableau of a series of images, fixed in the
imagination, to which is then attached the series of
ideas forming the composition to be learned by rote.
Considering the heterogeneity between the import of
these ideas and those permanent images, and the speed
with which the attachment has to be made, the attachment
cannot be made otherwise than by shallow, silly,
and utterly accidental links. Not merely is the mind
put to the torture of being worried by idiotic stuff, but
what is thus learnt by rote is just as quickly forgotten,
seeing that the same tableau is used for getting by rote
every other series of ideas, and so those previously
attached to it are effaced. What is mnemonically
<pb n='086'/><anchor id='Pg086'/>
impressed is not like what is retained in memory really
got by heart, i.e. strictly produced from within outwards,
from the deep pit of the ego, and thus recited,
but is, so to speak, read off the tableau of fancy.&mdash;Mnemonic
is connected with the common prepossession
about memory, in comparison with fancy and imagination;
as if the latter were a higher and more intellectual
activity than memory. On the contrary, memory has
ceased to deal with an image derived from intuition,&mdash;the
immediate and incomplete mode of intelligence; it
has rather to do with an object which is the product of
intelligence itself,&mdash;such a <emph>without book</emph><note place='foot'><foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Auswendiges.</foreign></note> as remains
locked up in the <emph>within-book</emph><note place='foot'><foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Inwendiges.</foreign></note> of intelligence, and is,
within intelligence, only its outward and existing side.
</p>

<p>
§ 463. (3) As the interconnexion of the names lies in
the meaning, the conjunction of their meaning with the
reality as names is still an (external) synthesis; and
intelligence in this its externality has not made a complete
and simple return into self. But intelligence is
the universal,&mdash;the single plain truth of its particular
self-divestments; and its consummated appropriation of
them abolishes that distinction between meaning and
name. This extreme inwardising of representation is
the supreme self-divestment of intelligence, in which it
renders itself the mere <emph>being</emph>, the universal space of
names as such, i.e. of meaningless words. The ego,
which is this abstract being, is, because subjectivity, at
the same time the power over the different names,&mdash;the
link which, having nothing in itself, fixes in itself series
of them and keeps them in stable order. So far as
they merely <emph>are</emph>, and intelligence is here itself this
<emph>being</emph> of theirs, its power is a merely abstract subjectivity,&mdash;memory;
which, on account of the complete
<pb n='087'/><anchor id='Pg087'/>
externality in which the members of such series stand
to one another, and because it is itself this externality
(subjective though that be), is called mechanical (§ 195).
</p>

<p>
A composition is, as we know, not thoroughly conned
by rote, until one attaches no meaning to the words.
The recitation of what has been thus got by heart is
therefore of course accentless. The correct accent,
if it is introduced, suggests the meaning: but this
introduction of the signification of an idea disturbs
the mechanical nexus and therefore easily throws out
the reciter. The faculty of conning by rote series of
words, with no principle governing their succession,
or which are separately meaningless, e.g. a series of
proper names, is so supremely marvellous, because it is
the very essence of mind to have its wits about it;
whereas in this case the mind is estranged in itself, and
its action is like machinery. But it is only as uniting
subjectivity with objectivity that the mind has its wits
about it. Whereas in the case before us, after it has in
intuition been at first so external as to pick up its
facts ready-made, and in representation inwardises or
recollects this datum and makes it its own,&mdash;it proceeds
as memory to make itself external in itself, so that what
is its own assumes the guise of something found. Thus
one of the two dynamic factors of thought, viz. objectivity,
is here put in intelligence itself as a quality of it.&mdash;It is
only a step further to treat memory as mechanical&mdash;the
act implying no intelligence&mdash;in which case it is
only justified by its uses, its indispensability perhaps for
other purposes and functions of mind. But by so doing
we overlook the proper signification it has in the mind.
</p>

<p>
§ 464. If it is to be the fact and true objectivity, the
mere name as an existent requires something else,&mdash;to
be interpreted by the representing intellect. Now in
the shape of mechanical memory, intelligence is at once
<pb n='088'/><anchor id='Pg088'/>
that external objectivity and the meaning. In this way
intelligence is explicitly made an <emph>existence</emph> of this
identity, i.e. it is explicitly active as such an identity
which as reason it is implicitly. Memory is in this
manner the passage into the function of <emph>thought</emph>, which
no longer has a <emph>meaning</emph>, i.e. its objectivity is no longer
severed from the subjective, and its inwardness does not
need to go outside for its existence.
</p>

<p>
The German language has etymologically assigned
memory (<foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Gedächtniß</foreign>), of which it has become a foregone
conclusion to speak contemptuously, the high position
of direct kindred with thought (<foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Gedanke</foreign>).&mdash;It is not
matter of chance that the young have a better memory
than the old, nor is their memory solely exercised for
the sake of utility. The young have a good memory
because they have not yet reached the stage of reflection;
their memory is exercised with or without design so as
to level the ground of their inner life to pure being or
to pure space in which the fact, the implicit content, may
reign and unfold itself with no antithesis to a subjective
inwardness. Genuine ability is in youth generally
combined with a good memory. But empirical statements
of this sort help little towards a knowledge of
what memory intrinsically is. To comprehend the
position and meaning of memory and to understand its
organic interconnexion with thought is one of the
hardest points, and hitherto one quite unregarded in the
theory of mind. Memory <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>quâ</foreign> memory is itself the
merely <emph>external</emph> mode, or merely <emph>existential</emph> aspect of
thought, and thus needs a complementary element. The
passage from it to thought is to our view and implicitly
the identity of reason with this existential mode: an
identity from which it follows that reason only exists in
a subject, and as the function of that subject. Thus
active reason is <emph>Thinking</emph>.

<p>
§ 465. Intelligence is recognitive: it cognises an intuition,
but only because that intuition is already its own
(§ <ref target='Section_454'>454</ref>); and in the name it re-discovers the fact (§ <ref target='Section_462'>462</ref>):
but now it finds <emph>its</emph> universal in the double signification
of the universal as such, and of the universal as
immediate or as being,&mdash;finds i.e. the genuine universal
which is its own unity overlapping and including its
other, viz. being. Thus intelligence is explicitly, and on
its own part cognitive: <emph>virtually</emph> it is the universal,&mdash;its
product (the thought) is the thing: it is a plain identity
of subjective and objective. It knows that what is
<emph>thought</emph>, <emph>is</emph>, and that what <emph>is</emph>, only <emph>is</emph> in so far as it is
a thought (§ <ref target='Section_521'>521</ref>); the thinking of intelligence is to <emph>have
thoughts</emph>: these are as its content and object.
</p>

<p>
§ 466. But cognition by thought is still in the first
instance formal: the universality and its being is the
plain subjectivity of intelligence. The thoughts therefore
are not yet fully and freely determinate, and the
representations which have been inwardised to thoughts
are so far still the given content.
</p>

<p>
§ 467. As dealing with this given content, thought is
(α) <emph>understanding</emph> with its formal identity, working up
the representations, that have been memorised, into
species, genera, laws, forces, &amp;c., in short into categories,&mdash;thus
indicating that the raw material does not get the
truth of its being save in these thought-forms. As
intrinsically infinite negativity, thought is (β) essentially
an act of partition,&mdash;<emph>judgment</emph>, which however does not
break up the concept again into the old antithesis of
universality and being, but distinguishes on the lines
supplied by the interconnexions peculiar to the concept.
Thirdly (γ), thought supersedes the formal distinction and
<pb n='090'/><anchor id='Pg090'/>
institutes at the same time an identity of the differences,&mdash;thus
being nominal <emph>reason</emph> or inferential understanding.
Intelligence, as the act of thought, cognises.
And (α) understanding out of its generalities (the
categories) <emph>explains</emph> the individual, and is then said to
comprehend or understand itself: (β) in the judgment it
explains the individual to be an universal (species, genus).
In these forms the <emph>content</emph> appears as given: (γ) but in
inference (syllogism) it characterises a content from
itself, by superseding that form-difference. With the
perception of the necessity, the last immediacy still
attaching to formal thought has vanished.
</p>

<p>
In <emph>Logic</emph> there was thought, but in its implicitness,
and as reason develops itself in this distinction-lacking
medium. So in <emph>consciousness</emph> thought occurs as a stage
(§ <ref target='Section_437'>437</ref> note). Here reason is as the truth of the antithetical
distinction, as it had taken shape within the
mind's own limits. Thought thus recurs again and
again in these different parts of philosophy, because
these parts are different only through the medium they
are in and the antithesis they imply; while thought is
this one and the same centre, to which as to their truth
the antithesis return.
</p>

<p>
§ 468. Intelligence which as theoretical appropriates
an immediate mode of being, is, now that it has completed
<emph>taking possession</emph>, in its own <emph>property</emph>: the last
negation of immediacy has implicitly required that the
intelligence shall itself determine its content. Thus
thought, as free notion, is now also free in point of
<emph>content</emph>. But when intelligence is aware that it is
determinative of the content, which is <emph>its</emph> mode no less
than it is a mode of being, it is Will.

<p>
§ 469. As will, the mind is aware that it is the author
of its own conclusions, the origin of its self-fulfilment.
Thus fulfilled, this independency or individuality form
the side of existence or of <emph>reality</emph> for the Idea of
mind. As will, the mind steps into actuality; whereas
as cognition it is on the soil of notional generality.
Supplying its own content, the will is self-possessed,
and in the widest sense free: this is its characteristic
trait. Its finitude lies in the formalism that the
spontaneity of its self-fulfilment means no more than
a general and abstract ownness, not yet identified with
matured reason. It is the function of the essential will
to bring liberty to exist in the formal will, and it is
therefore the aim of that formal will to fill itself with
its essential nature, i.e. to make liberty its pervading
character, content, and aim, as well as its sphere of
existence. The essential freedom of will is, and must
always be, a thought: hence the way by which will can
make itself objective mind is to rise to be a thinking
will,&mdash;to give itself the content which it can only have
as it thinks itself.
</p>

<p>
True liberty, in the shape of moral life, consists in
the will finding its purpose in a universal content, not
in subjective or selfish interests. But such a content is
only possible in thought and through thought: it is
nothing short of absurd to seek to banish thought from
the moral, religious, and law-abiding life.
</p>

<p>
§ 470. Practical mind, considered at first as formal
or immediate will, contains a double ought&mdash;(1) in the
contrast which the new mode of being projected outward
by the will offers to the immediate positivity of its
old existence and condition,&mdash;an antagonism which in
<pb n='092'/><anchor id='Pg092'/>
consciousness grows to correlation with external objects.
(2) That first self-determination, being itself immediate,
is not at once elevated into a thinking universality:
the latter, therefore, virtually constitutes an obligation
on the former in point of form, as it may also constitute
it in point of matter;&mdash;a distinction which only exists
for the observer.

<div>
<head>(α) Practical Sense or Feeling<note place='foot'><foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Der praktische Gefühl.</foreign></note>.</head>

<p>
§ 471. The autonomy of the practical mind at first is
immediate and therefore formal, i.e. it <emph>finds</emph> itself as an
<emph>individuality</emph> determined in <emph>its</emph> inward <emph>nature</emph>. It is thus
<q>practical feeling,</q> or instinct of action. In this phase,
as it is at bottom a subjectivity simply identical with
reason, it has no doubt a rational content, but a content
which as it stands is individual, and for that reason also
natural, contingent and subjective,&mdash;a content which
may be determined quite as much by mere personalities
of want and opinion, &amp;c., and by the subjectivity which
selfishly sets itself against the universal, as it may be
virtually in conformity with reason.
</p>

<p>
An appeal is sometimes made to the sense (feeling)
of right and morality, as well as of religion, which man
is alleged to possess,&mdash;to his benevolent dispositions,&mdash;and
even to his heart generally,&mdash;i.e. to the subject so
far as the various practical feelings are in it all combined.
So far as this appeal implies (1) that these ideas
are immanent in his own self, and (2) that when feeling
is opposed to the logical understanding, it, and not the
partial abstractions of the latter, <emph>may</emph> be the <emph>totality</emph>&mdash;the
appeal has a legitimate meaning. But on the other
hand feeling too <emph>may</emph> be onesided, unessential and bad.
The rational, which exists in the shape of rationality
when it is apprehended by thought, is the same content
<pb n='093'/><anchor id='Pg093'/>
as the <emph>good</emph> practical feeling has, but presented in its
universality and necessity, in its objectivity and truth.
</p>

<p>
Thus it is on the one hand <emph>silly</emph> to suppose that in the
passage from feeling to law and duty there is any loss
of import and excellence; it is this passage which lets
feeling first reach its truth. It is equally silly to consider
intellect as superfluous or even harmful to feeling,
heart, and will; the truth and, what is the same thing,
the actual rationality of the heart and will can only be
at home in the universality of intellect, and not in the
singleness of feeling as feeling. If feelings are of the
right sort, it is because of their quality or content,&mdash;which
is right only so far as it is intrinsically universal
or has its source in the thinking mind. The difficulty
for the logical intellect consists in throwing off the
separation it has arbitrarily imposed between the several
faculties of feeling and thinking mind, and coming to
see that in the human being there is only <emph>one</emph> reason,
in feeling, volition, and thought. Another difficulty
connected with this is found in the fact that the Ideas
which are the special property of the thinking mind,
viz. God, law and morality, can also be <emph>felt</emph>. But
feeling is only the form of the immediate and peculiar
individuality of the subject, in which these facts, like
any other objective facts (which consciousness also sets
over against itself), may be placed.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, it is <emph>suspicious</emph> or even worse to
cling to feeling and heart in place of the intelligent
rationality of law, right and duty; because all that the
former holds more than the latter is only the particular
subjectivity with its vanity and caprice. For the same
reason it is out of place in a scientific treatment of the
feelings to deal with anything beyond their form, and to
discuss their content; for the latter, when thought, is
precisely what constitutes, in their universality and
<pb n='094'/><anchor id='Pg094'/>
necessity, the rights and duties which are the true works
of mental autonomy. So long as we study practical
feelings and dispositions specially, we have only to deal
with the selfish, bad, and evil; it is these alone which
belong to the individuality which retains its opposition
to the universal: their content is the reverse of rights
and duties, and precisely in that way do they&mdash;but only
in antithesis to the latter&mdash;retain a speciality of their own.
</p>

<p>
§ 472. The <q>Ought</q> of practical feeling is the claim of
its essential autonomy to control some existing mode of
fact&mdash;which is assumed to be worth nothing save as
adapted to that claim. But as both, in their immediacy,
lack objective determination, this relation of the
<emph>requirement</emph> to existent fact is the utterly subjective and
superficial feeling of pleasant or unpleasant.
</p>

<p>
Delight, joy, grief, &amp;c., shame, repentance, contentment,
&amp;c., are partly only modifications of the formal
<q>practical feeling</q> in <emph>general</emph>, but are partly different in
the features that give the special tone and character
mode to their <q>Ought.</q>
</p>

<p>
The celebrated question as to the origin of evil in the
world, so far at least as evil is understood to mean
what is disagreeable and painful merely, arises on this
stage of the formal practical feeling. Evil is nothing
but the incompatibility between what is and what ought
to be. <q>Ought</q> is an ambiguous term,&mdash;indeed infinitely
so, considering that casual aims may also come
under the form of Ought. But where the objects sought
are thus casual, evil only executes what is rightfully due
to the vanity and nullity of their planning: for they
themselves were radically evil. The finitude of life and
mind is seen in their judgment: the contrary which
is separated from them they also have as a negative in
them, and thus they are the contradiction called evil. In
the dead there is neither evil nor pain: for in inorganic
<pb n='095'/><anchor id='Pg095'/>
nature the intelligible unity (concept) does not confront
its existence and does not in the difference at the same
time remain its permanent subject. Whereas in life,
and still more in mind, we have this immanent distinction
present: hence arises the Ought: and this
negativity, subjectivity, ego, freedom are the principles
of evil and pain. Jacob Böhme viewed egoity (selfhood)
as pain and torment, and as the fountain of nature and
of spirit.

<head>(β) The Impulses and Choice<note place='foot'><foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Der Triebe und die Willkühr.</foreign></note>.</head>

<p>
§ 473. The practical ought is a <q>real</q> judgment.
Will, which is essentially self-determination, finds in the
conformity&mdash;as immediate and merely <emph>found</emph> to hand&mdash;of
the existing mode to its requirement a negation, and
something inappropriate to it. If the will is to satisfy
itself, if the implicit unity of the universality and
the special mode is to be realised, the conformity of its
inner requirement and of the existent thing ought to be
its act and institution. The will, as regards the form of
its content, is at first still a natural will, directly
identical with its specific mode:&mdash;natural <emph>impulse</emph> and
<emph>inclination</emph>. Should, however, the totality of the practical
spirit throw itself into a single one of the many restricted
forms of impulse, each being always in conflict to another,
it is <emph>passion</emph>.
</p>

<p>
§ 474. Inclinations and passions embody the same
constituent features as the practical feeling. Thus,
while on one hand they are based on the rational
nature of the mind; they on the other, as part and
parcel of the still subjective and single will, are infected
with contingency, and appear as particular to stand to
the individual and to each other in an external relation
and with a necessity which creates bondage.
</p>

<pb n='096'/><anchor id='Pg096'/>

<p>
The special note in <emph>passion</emph> is its restriction to one
special mode of volition, in which the whole subjectivity
of the individual is merged, be the value of that mode
what it may. In consequence of this formalism, passion
is neither good nor bad; the title only states that
a subject has thrown his whole soul,&mdash;his interests of
intellect, talent, character, enjoyment,&mdash;on one aim and
object. Nothing great has been and nothing great can
be accomplished without passion. It is only a dead, too
often, indeed, a hypocritical moralising which inveighs
against the form of passion as such.
</p>

<p>
But with regard to the inclinations, the question is
directly raised, Which are good and bad?&mdash;Up to what
degree the good continue good;&mdash;and (as there are
many, each with its private range) In what way have
they, being all in one subject and hardly all, as experience
shows, admitting of gratification, to suffer at least
reciprocal restriction? And, first of all, as regards the
numbers of these impulses and propensities, the case is
much the same as with the psychical powers, whose
aggregate is to form the mind theoretical,&mdash;an aggregate
which is now increased by the host of impulses. The
nominal rationality of impulse and propensity lies
merely in their general impulse not to be subjective
merely, but to get realised, overcoming the subjectivity
by the subject's own agency. Their genuine rationality
cannot reveal its secret to a method of outer reflection
which pre-supposes a number of <emph>independent</emph> innate
tendencies and immediate instincts, and therefore is
wanting in a single principle and final purpose for them.
But the immanent <q>reflection</q> of mind itself carries it
beyond their particularity and their natural immediacy,
and gives their contents a rationality and objectivity,
in which they exist as necessary ties of social relation,
as rights and duties. It is this objectification which
<pb n='097'/><anchor id='Pg097'/>
evinces their real value, their mutual connexions, and
their truth. And thus it was a true perception when
Plato (especially including as he did the mind's whole
nature under its right) showed that the full reality of
justice could be exhibited only in the <emph>objective</emph> phase of
justice, viz. in the construction of the State as the
ethical life.
</p>

<p>
The answer to the question, therefore, What are the
good and rational propensities, and how they are to be
co-ordinated with each other? resolves itself into an
exposition of the laws and forms of common life produced
by the mind when developing itself as <emph>objective</emph>
mind&mdash;a development in which the <emph>content</emph> of autonomous
action loses its contingency and optionality. The
discussion of the true intrinsic worth of the impulses,
inclinations, and passions is thus essentially the theory
of legal, moral, and social <emph>duties</emph>.
</p>

<p>
§ 475. The subject is the act of satisfying impulses,
an act of (at least) formal rationality, as it translates
them from the subjectivity of content (which so far is
<emph>purpose</emph>) into objectivity, where the subject is made to
close with itself. If the content of the impulse is
distinguished as the thing or business from this act of
carrying it out, and we regard the thing which has been
brought to pass as containing the element of subjective
individuality and its action, this is what is called the
<emph>interest</emph>. Nothing therefore is brought about without
interest.
</p>

<p>
An action is an aim of the subject, and it is his
agency too which executes this aim: unless the subject
were in this way in the most disinterested action,
i.e. unless he had an interest in it, there would be no
action at all.&mdash;The impulses and inclinations are sometimes
depreciated by being contrasted with the baseless
chimera of a happiness, the free gift of nature, where
<pb n='098'/><anchor id='Pg098'/>
wants are supposed to find their satisfaction without
the agent doing anything to produce a conformity
between immediate existence and his own inner requirements.
They are sometimes contrasted, on the whole
to their disadvantage, with the morality of duty for
duty's sake. But impulse and passion are the very
life-blood of all action: they are needed if the agent is
really to be in his aim and the execution thereof. The
morality concerns the content of the aim, which as such
is the universal, an inactive thing, that finds its actualising
in the agent; and finds it only when the aim is
immanent in the agent, is his interest and&mdash;should it
claim to engross his whole efficient subjectivity&mdash;his
passion.
</p>

<p>
§ 476. The will, as thinking and implicitly free, distinguishes
itself from the particularity of the impulses,
and places itself as simple subjectivity of thought
above their diversified content. It is thus <q>reflecting</q>
will.
</p>

<p>
§ 477. Such a particularity of impulse has thus ceased
to be a mere datum: the reflective will now sees it as
its own, because it closes with it and thus gives itself
specific individuality and actuality. It is now on the
standpoint of <emph>choosing</emph> between inclinations, and is
option or <emph>choice</emph>.
</p>

<p>
§ 478. Will as choice claims to be free, reflected
into itself as the negativity of its merely immediate
autonomy. However, as the content, in which its
former universality concludes itself to actuality, is
nothing but the content of the impulses and appetites,
it is actual only as a subjective and contingent will. It
realises itself in a particularity, which it regards at the
same time as a nullity, and finds a satisfaction in what
it has at the same time emerged from. As thus contradictory,
it is the process of distracting and suspending
<pb n='099'/><anchor id='Pg099'/>
one desire or enjoyment by another,&mdash;and one satisfaction,
which is just as much no satisfaction, by
another, without end. But the truth of the particular
satisfactions is the universal, which under the name of
<emph>happiness</emph> the thinking will makes its aim.

<head>(γ) Happiness<note place='foot'><foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Die Glückseligkeit.</foreign></note>.</head>

<p>
<anchor id='Section_479'/>
§ 479. In this idea, which reflection and comparison
have educed, of a universal satisfaction, the impulses,
so far as their particularity goes, are reduced to a mere
negative; and it is held that in part they are to be
sacrificed to each other for the behoof that aim, partly
sacrificed to that aim directly, either altogether or in
part. Their mutual limitation, on one hand, proceeds
from a mixture of qualitative and quantitative considerations:
on the other hand, as happiness has its sole
<emph>affirmative</emph> contents in the springs of action, it is on
them that the decision turns, and it is the subjective
feeling and good pleasure which must have the casting
vote as to where happiness is to be placed.
</p>

<p>
§ 480. Happiness is the mere abstract and merely
imagined universality of things desired,&mdash;a universality
which only ought to be. But the particularity of the
satisfaction which just as much <emph>is</emph> as it is abolished, and
the abstract singleness, the option which gives or does
not give itself (as it pleases) an aim in happiness, find
their truth in the intrinsic <emph>universality</emph> of the will, i.e. its
very autonomy or freedom. In this way choice is will
only as pure subjectivity, which is pure and concrete at
once, by having for its contents and aim only that
infinite mode of being&mdash;freedom itself. In this truth of
its autonomy, where concept and object are one, the
will is an <emph>actually free will</emph>.

<head>Free Mind<note place='foot'><foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Der freie Geist.</foreign></note>.</head>

<p>
§ 481. Actual free will is the unity of theoretical and
practical mind: a free will, which realises its own freedom
of will now that the formalism, fortuitousness, and
contractedness of the practical content up to this point
have been superseded. By superseding the adjustments
of means therein contained, the will is the <emph>immediate
individuality</emph> self-instituted,&mdash;an individuality, however,
also purified of all that interferes with its universalism,
i.e. with freedom itself. This universalism the will has
as its object and aim, only so far as it thinks itself,
knows this its concept, and is <emph>will</emph> as free <emph>intelligence</emph>.
</p>

<p>
§ 482. The mind which knows itself as free and wills
itself as this its object, i.e. which has its true being for
characteristic and aim, is in the first instance the rational
will in general, or <emph>implicit</emph> Idea, and because implicit
only the <emph>notion</emph> of absolute mind. As <emph>abstract</emph> Idea
again, it is existent only in the <emph>immediate</emph> will&mdash;it is the
<emph>existential</emph> side of reason,&mdash;the <emph>single</emph> will as aware of
this its universality constituting its contents and aim,
and of which it is only the formal activity. If the will,
therefore, in which the Idea thus appears is only finite,
that will is also the act of developing the Idea, and of
investing its self-unfolding content with an existence
which, as realising the idea, is <emph>actuality</emph>. It is thus
<q>Objective</q> Mind.
</p>

<p>
No Idea is so generally recognised as indefinite,
ambiguous, and open to the greatest misconceptions (to
which therefore it actually falls a victim) as the idea of
Liberty: none in common currency with so little appreciation
of its meaning. Remembering that free mind
is <emph>actual</emph> mind, we can see how misconceptions about it
are of tremendous consequence in practice. When
individuals and nations have once got in their heads
<pb n='101'/><anchor id='Pg101'/>
the abstract concept of full-blown liberty, there is
nothing like it in its uncontrollable strength, just
because it is the very essence of mind, and that as its
very actuality. Whole continents, Africa and the East,
have never had this idea, and are without it still. The
Greeks and Romans, Plato and Aristotle, even the
Stoics, did not have it. On the contrary, they saw that
it is only by birth (as e.g. an Athenian or Spartan
citizen), or by strength of character, education, or
philosophy (&mdash;the sage is free even as a slave and in
chains) that the human being is actually free. It was
through Christianity that this idea came into the world.
According to Christianity, the individual <emph>as such</emph> has an
infinite value as the object and aim of divine love,
destined as mind to live in absolute relationship
with God himself, and have God's mind dwelling in
him: i.e. man is implicitly destined to supreme freedom.
If, in religion as such, man is aware of this
relationship to the absolute mind as his true being, he
has also, even when he steps into the sphere of secular
existence, the divine mind present with him, as the
substance of the state of the family, &amp;c. These institutions
are due to the guidance of that spirit, and are constituted
after its measure; whilst by their existence the
moral temper comes to be indwelling in the individual,
so that in this sphere of particular existence, of present
sensation and volition, he is <emph>actually</emph> free.
</p>

<p>
If to be aware of the idea&mdash;to be aware, i.e. that men
are aware of freedom as their essence, aim, and object&mdash;is
matter of <emph>speculation</emph>, still this very idea itself is the
actuality of men&mdash;not something which they <emph>have</emph>, as
men, but which they <emph>are</emph>. Christianity in its adherents
has realised an ever-present sense that they are not
and cannot be slaves; if they are made slaves, if the
decision as regards their property rests with an arbitrary
<pb n='102'/><anchor id='Pg102'/>
will, not with laws or courts of justice, they would find
the very substance of their life outraged. This will to
liberty is no longer an <emph>impulse</emph> which demands its satisfaction,
but the permanent character&mdash;the spiritual consciousness
grown into a non-impulsive nature. But this
freedom, which the content and aim of freedom has, is
itself only a notion&mdash;a principle of the mind and heart,
intended to develope into an objective phase, into legal,
moral, religious, and not less into scientific actuality.

<head>Section II. Mind Objective.</head>

<p>
§ 483. The objective Mind is the absolute Idea, but
only existing <foreign rend='italic'>in posse</foreign>: and as it is thus on the
territory of finitude, its actual rationality retains the
aspect of external apparency. The free will finds itself
immediately confronted by differences which arise from
the circumstance that freedom is its <emph>inward</emph> function
and aim, and is in relation to an external and already
subsisting objectivity, which splits up into different
heads: viz. anthropological data (i.e. private and
personal needs), external things of nature which exist
for consciousness, and the ties of relation between
individual wills which are conscious of their own
diversity and particularity. These aspects constitute
the external material for the embodiment of the will.
</p>

<p>
§ 484. But the purposive action of this will is to realise
its concept, Liberty, in these externally-objective aspects,
making the latter a world moulded by the former, which
in it is thus at home with itself, locked together with it:
the concept accordingly perfected to the Idea. Liberty,
shaped into the actuality of a world, receives the <emph>form of
Necessity</emph> the deeper substantial nexus of which is the
system or organisation of the principles of liberty,
whilst its phenomenal nexus is power or authority,
<pb n='104'/><anchor id='Pg104'/>
and the sentiment of obedience awakened in consciousness.
</p>

<p>
§ 485. This unity of the rational will with the single
will (this being the peculiar and immediate medium in
which the former is actualised) constitutes the simple
actuality of liberty. As it (and its content) belongs to
thought, and is the virtual <emph>universal</emph>, the content has its
right and true character only in the form of universality.
When invested with this character for the intelligent
consciousness, or instituted as an authoritative power,
it is a <emph>Law</emph><note place='foot'><foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Gesess.</foreign></note>. When, on the other hand, the content
is freed from the mixedness and fortuitousness, attaching
to it in the practical feeling and in impulse, and is
set and grafted in the individual will, not in the form
of impulse, but in its universality, so as to become its
habit, temper and character, it exists as manner and
custom, or <emph>Usage</emph><note place='foot'><foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Sitte.</foreign></note>.
</p>

<p>
§ 486. This <q>reality,</q> in general, where free will has
<emph>existence</emph>, is the <emph>Law</emph> (Right),&mdash;the term being taken in
a comprehensive sense not merely as the limited juristic
law, but as the actual body of all the conditions of freedom.
These conditions, in relation to the <emph>subjective</emph> will,
where they, being universal, ought to have and can
only have their existence, are its <emph>Duties</emph>; whereas as
its temper and habit they are <emph>Manners</emph>. What is
a right is also a duty, and what is a duty, is also a right.
For a mode of existence is a right, only as a consequence
of the free substantial will: and the same content of fact,
when referred to the will distinguished as subjective
and individual, is a duty. It is the same content which
the subjective consciousness recognises as a duty, and
brings into existence in these several wills. The
finitude of the objective will thus creates the semblance
of a distinction between rights and duties.
</p>

<pb n='105'/><anchor id='Pg105'/>

<p>
In the phenomenal range right and duty are <foreign rend='italic'>correlata</foreign>,
at least in the sense that to a right on my part corresponds
a duty in some one else. But, in the light of the
concept, my right to a thing is not merely possession, but
as possession by a <emph>person</emph> it is <emph>property</emph>, or legal possession,
and it is a <emph>duty</emph> to possess things as <emph>property</emph>, i.e. to be
as a person. Translated into the phenomenal relationship,
viz. relation to another person&mdash;this grows into
the duty of some one <emph>else</emph> to respect <emph>my</emph> right. In the
morality of the conscience, duty in general is in me&mdash;a
free subject&mdash;at the same time a right of my subjective
will or disposition. But in this individualist moral
sphere, there arises the division between what is only
inward purpose (disposition or intention), which only
has its being in me and is merely subjective duty, and
the actualisation of that purpose: and with this division
a contingency and imperfection which makes the
inadequacy of mere individualistic morality. In social
ethics these two parts have reached their truth, their
absolute unity; although even right and duty return to
one another and combine by means of certain adjustments
and under the guise of necessity. The rights of
the father of the family over its members are equally
duties towards them; just as the children's duty of
obedience is their right to be educated to the liberty of
manhood. The penal judicature of a government, its
rights of administration, &amp;c., are no less its duties to
punish, to administer, &amp;c.; as the services of the
members of the State in dues, military services, &amp;c., are
duties and yet their right to the protection of their
private property and of the general substantial life in
which they have their root. All the aims of society
and the State are the private aim of the individuals.
But the set of adjustments, by which their duties come
back to them as the exercise and enjoyment of right,
<pb n='106'/><anchor id='Pg106'/>
produces an appearance of diversity: and this diversity
is increased by the variety of shapes which value assumes
in the course of exchange, though it remains intrinsically
the same. Still it holds fundamentally good that he
who has no rights has no duties and <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>vice versa</foreign>.

<p>
<anchor id='Section_488'/>
§ 488. Mind, in the immediacy of its self-secured
liberty, is an individual, but one that knows its
individuality as an absolutely free will: it is a <emph>person</emph>, in
whom the inward sense of this freedom, as in itself still
abstract and empty, has its particularity and fulfilment
not yet on its own part, but on an external <emph>thing</emph>. This
thing, as something devoid of will, has no rights against
the subjectivity of intelligence and volition, and is by
that subjectivity made adjectival to it, the external sphere
of its liberty;&mdash;<emph>possession</emph>.
</p>

<p>
§ 489. By the judgment of possession, at first in
the outward appropriation, the thing acquires the predicate
of <q>mine.</q> But this predicate, on its own
account merely <q>practical,</q> has here the signification
that I import my personal will into the thing. As so
characterised, possession is <emph>property</emph>, which as possession
is a <emph>means</emph>, but as existence of the personality is
an <emph>end</emph>.
</p>

<p>
§ 490. In his property the person is brought into
union with itself. But the thing is an abstractly
external thing, and the I in it is abstractly external.
The concrete return of me into me in the externality is
<pb n='108'/><anchor id='Pg108'/>
that I, the infinite self-relation, am as a person the
repulsion of me from myself, and have the existence of
my personality in the <emph>being of other persons</emph>, in my
relation to them and in my recognition by them, which
is thus mutual.
</p>

<p>
<anchor id='Section_491'/>
§ 491. The thing is the <emph>mean</emph> by which the extremes
meet in one. These extremes are the persons who, in
the knowledge of their identity as free, are simultaneously
mutually independent. For them my will has its
<emph>definite recognisable existence</emph> in the thing by the immediate
bodily act of taking possession, or by the formation
of the thing or, it may be, by mere designation
of it.
</p>

<p>
§ 492. The casual aspect of property is that I place
my will in <emph>this</emph> thing: so far my will is <emph>arbitrary</emph>, I can
just as well put it in it as not,&mdash;just as well withdraw it
as not. But so far as my will lies in a thing, it is only
I who can withdraw it: it is only with my will that
the thing can pass to another, whose property it
similarly becomes only with his will:&mdash;<emph>Contract</emph>.
</p>

</div>

<div>
<head>(b) Contract.</head>

<p>
<anchor id='Section_493'/>
§ 493. The two wills and their agreement in the contract
are as an <emph>internal</emph> state of mind different from its
realisation in the <emph>performance</emph>. The comparatively
<q>ideal</q> utterance (of contract) in the <emph>stipulation</emph> contains
the actual surrender of a property by the one, its
changing hands, and its acceptance by the other will.
The contract is thus thoroughly binding: it does not
need the performance of the one or the other to become
so&mdash;otherwise we should have an infinite regress or
infinite division of thing, labour, and time. The utterance
in the stipulation is complete and exhaustive. The
inwardness of the will which surrenders and the will
which accepts the property is in the realm of ideation,
<pb n='109'/><anchor id='Pg109'/>
and in that realm the word is deed and thing (§ <ref target='Section_462'>462</ref>)&mdash;the
full and complete deed, since here the conscientiousness
of the will does not come under consideration
(as to whether the thing is meant in earnest or is a deception),
and the will refers only to the external thing.
</p>

<p>
§ 494. Thus in the stipulation we have the <emph>substantial</emph>
being of the contract standing out in distinction from
its real utterance in the performance, which is brought
down to a mere sequel. In this way there is put into
the thing or performance a distinction between its
immediate specific <emph>quality</emph> and its substantial being or
<emph>value</emph>, meaning by value the quantitative terms into
which that qualitative feature has been translated.
One piece of property is thus made comparable with
another, and may be made equivalent to a thing which
is (in quality) wholly heterogeneous. It is thus treated
in general as an abstract, universal thing or commodity.
</p>

<p>
§ 495. The contract, as an agreement which has
a voluntary origin and deals with a casual commodity,
involves at the same time the giving to this <q>accidental</q>
will a positive fixity. This will may just as well not be
conformable to law (right), and, in that case, produces
a <emph>wrong</emph>: by which however the absolute law (right)
is not superseded, but only a relationship originated of
right to wrong.
</p>

</div>

<div>
<head>(c) Right versus Wrong.</head>

<p>
§ 496. Law (right) considered as the realisation of
liberty in externals, breaks up into a multiplicity of
relations to this external sphere and to other persons
(§§ <ref target='Section_491'>491</ref>, <ref target='Section_493'>493</ref> seqq.). In this way there are (1) several
titles or grounds at law, of which (seeing that property
both on the personal and the real side is exclusively
individual) only one is the right, but which, because they
face each other, each and all are invested with a <emph>show</emph>
<pb n='110'/><anchor id='Pg110'/>
of right, against which the former is defined as the
intrinsically right.
</p>

<p>
§ 497. Now so long as (compared against this show)
the one intrinsically right, still presumed identical
with the several titles, is affirmed, willed, and recognised,
the only diversity lies in this, that the special
thing is subsumed under the one law or right by
the <emph>particular</emph> will of <emph>these</emph> several persons. This is
naïve, non-malicious wrong. Such wrong in the several
claimants is a simple <emph>negative judgment</emph>, expressing
the <emph>civil suit</emph>. To settle it there is required a third
judgment, which, as the judgment of the intrinsically
right, is disinterested, and a power of giving the one
right existence as against that semblance.
</p>

<p>
§ 498. But (2) if the semblance of right is willed as
such <emph>against</emph> right intrinsical by the particular will,
which thus becomes <emph>wicked</emph>, then the external <emph>recognition</emph>
of right is separated from the right's true value;
and while the former only is respected, the latter is
violated. This gives the wrong of <emph>fraud</emph>&mdash;the infinite
judgment as identical (§ 173),&mdash;where the nominal
relation is retained, but the sterling value is let slip.
</p>

<p>
§ 499. (3) Finally, the particular will sets itself in
opposition to the intrinsic right by negating that right
itself as well as its recognition or semblance. [Here
there is a negatively infinite judgment (§ 173) in which
there is denied the class as a whole, and not merely the
particular mode&mdash;in this case the apparent recognition.]
Thus the will is violently wicked, and commits
a <emph>crime</emph>.
</p>

<p>
<anchor id='Section_500'/>
§ 500. As an outrage on right, such an action is
essentially and actually null. In it the agent, as
a volitional and intelligent being, sets up a law&mdash;a law
however which is nominal and recognised by him only&mdash;a
universal which holds good <emph>for him</emph>, and under which
<pb n='111'/><anchor id='Pg111'/>
he has at the same time subsumed himself by his
action. To display the nullity of such an act, to carry
out simultaneously this nominal law and the intrinsic
right, in the first instance by means of a subjective
individual will, is the work of <emph>Revenge</emph>. But, revenge,
starting from the interest of an immediate particular
personality, is at the same time only a new outrage;
and so on without end. This progression, like the
last, abolishes itself in a third judgment, which is
disinterested&mdash;<emph>punishment</emph>.
</p>

<p>
§ 501. The instrumentality by which authority is given
to intrinsic right is (α) that a particular will, that of the
judge, being conformable to the right, has an interest to
turn against the crime (&mdash;which in the first instance, in
revenge, is a matter of chance), and (β) that an executive
power (also in the first instance casual) negates the
negation of right that was created by the criminal.
This negation of right has its existence in the will of
the criminal; and consequently revenge or punishment
directs itself against the person or property of the
criminal and exercises <emph>coercion</emph> upon him. It is in this
legal sphere that coercion in general has possible
scope,&mdash;compulsion against the thing, in seizing and
maintaining it against another's seizure: for in this
sphere the will has its existence immediately in externals
as such, or in corporeity, and can be seized
only in this quarter. But more than <emph>possible</emph> compulsion
is not, so long as I can withdraw myself as
free from every mode of existence, even from the
range of all existence, i.e. from life. It is legal only
as abolishing a first and original compulsion.
</p>

<p>
§ 502. A distinction has thus emerged between the
law (right) and the subjective will. The <q>reality</q> of
right, which the personal will in the first instance gives
itself in immediate wise, is seen to be due to the
<pb n='112'/><anchor id='Pg112'/>
instrumentality of the subjective will,&mdash;whose influence
as on one hand it gives existence to the essential right,
so may on the other cut itself off from and oppose itself
to it. Conversely, the claim of the subjective will to be
in this abstraction a power over the law of right is null
and empty of itself: it gets truth and reality essentially
only so far as that will in itself realises the reasonable
will. As such it is <emph>morality</emph><note place='foot'><foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Moralität.</foreign></note> proper.
</p>

<p>
The phrase <q>Law of Nature,</q> or Natural Right<note place='foot'><foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Naturrecht.</foreign></note>,
in use for the philosophy of law involves the ambiguity
that it may mean either right as something existing
ready-formed in nature, or right as governed by the
nature of things, i.e. by the notion. The former
used to be the common meaning, accompanied with the
fiction of a <emph>state of nature</emph>, in which the law of nature
should hold sway; whereas the social and political state
rather required and implied a restriction of liberty and
a sacrifice of natural rights. The real fact is that the
whole law and its every article are based on free personality
alone,&mdash;on self-determination or autonomy, which
is the very contrary of determination by nature. The
law of nature&mdash;strictly so called&mdash;is for that reason the
predominance of the strong and the reign of force, and
a state of nature a state of violence and wrong, of which
nothing truer can be said than that one ought to depart
from it. The social state, on the other hand, is the
condition in which alone right has its actuality: what is
to be restricted and sacrificed is just the wilfulness and
violence of the state of nature.

<p>
<anchor id='Section_503'/>
§ 503. The free individual, who, in mere law, counts
only as a <emph>person</emph>, is now characterised as a <emph>subject</emph>,
a will reflected into itself so that, be its affection what
it may, it is distinguished (as existing in it) as <emph>its own</emph>
from the existence of freedom in an external thing.
Because the affection of the will is thus inwardised,
the will is at the same time made a particular, and
there arise further particularisations of it and relations
of these to one another. This affection is partly
the essential and implicit will, the reason of the will,
the essential basis of law and moral life: partly it is
the existent volition, which is before us and throws itself
into actual deeds, and thus comes into relationship with
the former. The subjective will is <emph>morally</emph> free, so far as
these features are its inward institution, its own, and
willed by it. Its utterance in deed with this freedom is
an <emph>action</emph>, in the externality of which it only admits as
its own, and allows to be imputed to it, so much as it
has consciously willed.
</p>

<p>
This subjective or <q>moral</q> freedom is what a European
especially calls freedom. In virtue of the right thereto
a man must possess a personal knowledge of the distinction
between good and evil in general: ethical and
<pb n='114'/><anchor id='Pg114'/>
religious principles shall not merely lay their claim on
him as external laws and precepts of authority to be
obeyed, but have their assent, recognition, or even
justification in his heart, sentiment, conscience, intelligence,
&amp;c. The subjectivity of the will in itself is its
supreme aim and absolutely essential to it.
</p>

<p>
The <q>moral</q> must be taken in the wider sense in
which it does not signify the morally good merely. In
French <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>le moral</foreign> is opposed to <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>le physique</foreign>, and means
the mental or intellectual in general. But here the
moral signifies volitional mode, so far as it is in the
interior of the will in general; it thus includes purpose
and intention,&mdash;and also moral wickedness.
</p>

<p>
§ 504. So far as the action comes into immediate
touch with <emph>existence</emph>, <emph>my part</emph> in it is to this extent
formal, that external existence is also <emph>independent</emph> of the
agent. This externality can pervert his action and
bring to light something else than lay in it. Now,
though any alteration as such, which is set on foot
by the subject's action, is its <emph>deed</emph><note place='foot'><foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>That.</foreign></note>, still the subject
does not for that reason recognise it as its <emph>action</emph><note place='foot'><foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Handlung.</foreign></note>,
but only admits as its own that existence in the deed
which lay in its knowledge and will, which was its
<emph>purpose</emph>. Only for that does it hold itself <emph>responsible</emph>.

<p>
§ 505. As regards its empirically concrete <emph>content</emph>
(1) the action has a variety of particular aspects and
connexions. In point of <emph>form</emph>, the agent must have
known and willed the action in its essential feature,
embracing these individual points. This is the right of
<pb n='115'/><anchor id='Pg115'/>
<emph>intention</emph>. While <emph>purpose</emph> affects only the immediate
fact of existence, <emph>intention</emph> regards the underlying
essence and aim thereof. (2) The agent has no less
the right to see that the particularity of content in the
action, in point of its matter, is not something external
to him, but is a particularity of his own,&mdash;that it contains
his needs, interests, and aims. These aims, when
similarly comprehended in a single aim, as in happiness
(§ <ref target='Section_479'>479</ref>), constitute his <emph>well-being</emph>. This is the right to
well-being. Happiness (good fortune) is distinguished
from well-being only in this, that happiness implies
no more than some sort of immediate existence,
whereas well-being regards it as also justified as
regards morality.
</p>

<p>
§ 506. But the essentiality of the intention is in the
first instance the abstract form of generality. Reflection
can put in this form this and that particular aspect in the
empirically-concrete action, thus making it essential to
the intention or restricting the intention to it. In this
way the supposed essentiality of the intention and the
real essentiality of the action may be brought into the
greatest contradiction&mdash;e.g. a good intention in case of
a crime. Similarly well-being is abstract and may be
set on this or that: as appertaining to this single agent,
it is always something particular.

<head>c. Goodness and Wickedness<note place='foot'><foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Das Gute und das Böse.</foreign></note>.</head>

<p>
§ 507. The truth of these particularities and the concrete
unity of their formalism is the content of the
universal, essential and actual, will,&mdash;the law and
underlying essence of every phase of volition, the
essential and actual good. It is thus the absolute final
aim of the world, and <emph>duty</emph> for the agent who <emph>ought</emph>
<pb n='116'/><anchor id='Pg116'/>
to have <emph>insight</emph> into the <emph>good</emph>, make it his <emph>intention</emph> and
bring it about by his activity.
</p>

<p>
§ 508. But though the good is the universal of will&mdash;a
universal determined in itself,&mdash;and thus including in
it particularity,&mdash;still so far as this particularity is in the
first instance still abstract, there is no principle at hand
to determine it. Such determination therefore starts
up also outside that universal; and as heteronomy or
determinance of a will which is free and has rights of
its own, there awakes here the deepest contradiction. (α)
In consequence of the indeterminate determinism of the
good, there are always <emph>several sorts</emph> of good and <emph>many
kinds of duties</emph>, the variety of which is a dialectic of one
against another and brings them into <emph>collision</emph>. At the
same time because good is one, they <emph>ought</emph> to stand in
harmony; and yet each of them, though it is a particular
duty, is as good and as duty absolute. It falls upon the
agent to be the dialectic which, superseding this absolute
claim of each, concludes such a combination of
them as excludes the rest.
</p>

<p>
§ 509. (β) To the agent, who in his existent sphere
of liberty is essentially as a <emph>particular</emph>, his <emph>interest and
welfare</emph> must, on account of that existent sphere of
liberty, be essentially an aim and therefore a duty. But
at the same time in aiming at the good, which is the not-particular
but only universal of the will, the particular
interest <emph>ought not</emph> to be a constituent motive. On
account of this independency of the two principles of
action, it is likewise an accident whether they harmonise.
And yet they <emph>ought</emph> to harmonise, because the agent, as
individual and universal, is always fundamentally one
identity.
</p>

<p>
(γ) But the agent is not only a mere particular in his
existence; it is also a form of his existence to be an
abstract self-certainty, an abstract reflection of freedom
<pb n='117'/><anchor id='Pg117'/>
into himself. He is thus distinct from the reason in
the will, and capable of making the universal itself
a particular and in that way a semblance. The good
is thus reduced to the level of a mere <q>may happen</q> for
the agent, who can therefore resolve itself to somewhat
opposite to the good, can be wicked.
</p>

<p>
§ 510. (δ) The external objectivity, following the distinction
which has arisen in the subjective will (§ <ref target='Section_503'>503</ref>),
constitutes a peculiar world of its own,&mdash;another extreme
which stands in no rapport with the internal
will-determination. It is thus a matter of chance,
whether it harmonises with the subjective aims, whether
the good is realised, and the wicked, an aim essentially
and actually null, nullified in it: it is no less matter
of chance whether the agent finds in it his well-being,
and more precisely whether in the world the good agent
is happy and the wicked unhappy. But at the same time
the world <emph>ought</emph> to allow the good action, the essential
thing, to be carried out in it; it <emph>ought</emph> to grant the good
agent the satisfaction of his particular interest, and
refuse it to the wicked; just as it <emph>ought</emph> also to make the
wicked itself null and void.
</p>

<p>
§ 511. The all-round contradiction, expressed by this
repeated <emph>ought</emph>, with its absoluteness which yet at the
same time is <emph>not</emph>&mdash;contains the most abstract 'analysis'
of the mind in itself, its deepest descent into itself. The
only relation the self-contradictory principles have to
one another is in the abstract certainty of self; and for
this infinitude of subjectivity the universal will, good,
right, and duty, no more exist than not. The subjectivity
alone is aware of itself as choosing and deciding.
This pure self-certitude, rising to its pitch, appears in
the two directly inter-changing forms&mdash;of <emph>Conscience</emph>
and <emph>Wickedness</emph>. The former is the will of goodness;
but a goodness which to this pure subjectivity is the
<pb n='118'/><anchor id='Pg118'/>
<emph>non-objective</emph>, non-universal, the unutterable; and over
which the agent is conscious that <emph>he</emph> in his <emph>individuality</emph>
has the decision. Wickedness is the same awareness
that the single self possesses the decision, so far as the
single self does not merely remain in this abstraction,
but takes up the content of a subjective interest contrary
to the good.
</p>

<p>
§ 512. This supreme pitch of the <q><emph>phenomenon</emph></q> of will,&mdash;sublimating
itself to this absolute vanity&mdash;to a goodness,
which has no objectivity, but is only sure of itself,
and a self-assurance which involves the nullification of
the universal&mdash;collapses by its own force. Wickedness,
as the most intimate reflection of subjectivity itself, in
opposition to the objective and universal, (which it treats
as mere sham,) is the same as the good sentiment of
abstract goodness, which reserves to the subjectivity the
determination thereof:&mdash;the utterly abstract semblance,
the bare perversion and annihilation of itself. The
result, the truth of this semblance, is, on its negative
side, the absolute nullity of this volition which would
fain hold its own against the good, and of the good,
which would only be abstract. On the affirmative side,
in the notion, this semblance thus collapsing is the same
simple universality of the will, which is the good. The
subjectivity, in this its <emph>identity</emph> with the good, is only the
infinite form, which actualises and developes it. In this
way the standpoint of bare reciprocity between two
independent sides,&mdash;the standpoint of the <emph>ought</emph>, is
abandoned, and we have passed into the field of ethical
life.

<p>
<anchor id='Section_513'/>
§ 513. The moral life is the perfection of spirit objective&mdash;the
truth of the subjective and objective spirit itself.
The failure of the latter consists&mdash;partly in having its
freedom <emph>immediately</emph> in reality, in something external
therefore, in a thing,&mdash;partly in the abstract universality
of its goodness. The failure of spirit subjective
similarly consists in this, that it is, as against the
universal, abstractly self-determinant in its inward individuality.
When these two imperfections are suppressed,
subjective <emph>freedom</emph> exists as the covertly and
overtly <emph>universal</emph> rational will, which is sensible of
itself and actively disposed in the consciousness of the
individual subject, whilst its practical operation and
immediate universal <emph>actuality</emph> at the same time exist as
moral usage, manner and custom,&mdash;where self-conscious
<emph>liberty</emph> has become <emph>nature</emph>.
</p>

<p>
§ 514. The consciously free substance, in which the
absolute <q>ought</q> is no less an <q>is,</q> has actuality as the
spirit of a nation. The abstract disruption of this
spirit singles it out into <emph>persons</emph>, whose independence it
however controls and entirely dominates from within.
But the person, as an intelligent being, feels that
underlying essence to be his own very being&mdash;ceases
when so minded to be a mere accident of it&mdash;looks upon
<pb n='120'/><anchor id='Pg120'/>
it as his absolute final aim. In its actuality he sees not
less an achieved present, than somewhat he brings it
about by his action,&mdash;yet somewhat which without all
question <emph>is</emph>. Thus, without any selective reflection, the
person performs its duty as <emph>his own</emph> and as something
which <emph>is</emph>; and in this necessity <emph>he</emph> has himself and his
actual freedom.
</p>

<p>
§ 515. Because the substance is the absolute unity of
individuality and universality of freedom, it follows that
the actuality and action of each individual to keep and
to take care of his own being, while it is on one hand
conditioned by the pre-supposed total in whose complex
alone he exists, is on the other a transition into
a universal product.&mdash;The social disposition of the individuals
is their sense of the substance, and of the
identity of all their interests with the total; and that the
other individuals mutually know each other and are
actual only in this identity, is confidence (trust)&mdash;the
genuine ethical temper.
</p>

<p>
§ 516. The relations between individuals in the several
situations to which the substance is particularised form
their <emph>ethical duties</emph>. The ethical personality, i.e. the
subjectivity which is permeated by the substantial life,
is <emph>virtue</emph>. In relation to the bare facts of external being,
to <emph>destiny</emph>, virtue does not treat them as a mere negation,
and is thus a quiet repose in itself: in relation to
substantial objectivity, to the total of ethical actuality,
it exists as confidence, as deliberate work for the community,
and the capacity of sacrificing self thereto;
whilst in relation to the incidental relations of social
circumstance, it is in the first instance justice and then
benevolence. In the latter sphere, and in its attitude
to its own visible being and corporeity, the individuality
expresses its special character, temperament, &amp;c. as
personal <emph>virtues</emph>.

§ 518. The ethical spirit, in its <emph>immediacy</emph>, contains

unanimity of love and the temper of trust.
In the shape of the family, mind appears as feeling.
</p>

<p>
§ 519. (1) The physical difference of sex thus appears
at the same time as a difference of intellectual and
moral type. With their exclusive individualities these
personalities combine to form a <emph>single person</emph>: the subjective
union of hearts, becoming a <q>substantial</q> unity,
makes this union an ethical tie&mdash;<emph>Marriage</emph>. The 'substantial'
union of hearts makes marriage an indivisible
personal bond&mdash;monogamic marriage: the bodily conjunction
is a sequel to the moral attachment. A further
sequel is community of personal and private interests.
</p>

<p>
§ 520. (2) By the community in which the various
members constituting the family stand in reference to
property, that property of the one person (representing
the family) acquires an ethical interest, as do also its
industry, labour, and care for the future.

<p>
<anchor id='Section_521'/>
§ 521. The ethical principle which is conjoined with

spiritual birth of the children,&mdash;in educating them to
independent personality.
</p>

<p>
§ 522. (3) The children, thus invested with independence,
leave the concrete life and action of the
family to which they primarily belong, acquire an
existence of their own, destined however to found
anew such an actual family. Marriage is of course
broken up by the <emph>natural</emph> element contained in it, the
death of husband and wife: but even their union of
hearts, as it is a mere <q>substantiality</q> of feeling, contains
the germ of liability to chance and decay. In virtue of
such fortuitousness, the members of the family take up to
each other the status of persons; and it is thus that the
family finds introduced into it for the first time the
element, originally foreign to it, of <emph>legal</emph> regulation.

§ 523. As the substance, being an intelligent substance,
particularises itself abstractly into many persons
(the family is only a single person), into families or
individuals, who exist independent and free, as private
persons, it loses its ethical character: for these
persons as such have in their consciousness and as
their aim not the absolute unity, but their own petty
selves and particular interests. Thus arises the system
of <emph>atomistic</emph>: by which the substance is reduced to
a general system of adjustments to connect self-subsisting
extremes and their particular interests. The
developed totality of this connective system is the state

§ 524. (α) The particularity of the persons includes in

the first instance their wants. The possibility of satisfying
these wants is here laid on the social fabric,
the general stock from which all derive their satisfaction.
In the condition of things in which this
method of satisfaction by indirect adjustment is realised,
immediate seizure (§ <ref target='Section_488'>488</ref>) of external objects as means
thereto exists barely or not at all: the objects are
already property. To acquire them is only possible by
the intervention, on one hand, of the possessors' will,
which as particular has in view the satisfaction of their
variously defined interests; while on the other hand it
is conditioned by the ever continued production of
fresh means of exchange by the exchangers' <emph>own
labour</emph>. This instrument, by which the labour of all
facilitates satisfaction of wants, constitutes the general
stock.
</p>

<p>
§ 525. (β) The glimmer of universal principle in this
particularity of wants is found in the way intellect
creates differences in them, and thus causes an indefinite
multiplication both of wants and of means for
their different phases. Both are thus rendered more
and more abstract. This <q>morcellement</q> of their content
by abstraction gives rise to the <emph>division of labour</emph>. The
habit of this abstraction in enjoyment, information,
feeling and demeanour, constitutes training in this
sphere, or nominal culture in general.
</p>

<p>
§ 526. The labour which thus becomes more abstract
tends on one hand by its uniformity to make labour
easier and to increase production,&mdash;on another to limit
each person to a single kind of technical skill, and thus
produce more unconditional dependence on the social
system. The skill itself becomes in this way mechanical,
and gets the capability of letting the machine take the
place of human labour.
</p>

<p>
<anchor id='Section_527'/>
§ 527. (γ) But the concrete division of the general
<pb n='124'/><anchor id='Pg124'/>
stock&mdash;which is also a general business (of the whole
society)&mdash;into particular masses determined by the
factors of the notion,&mdash;masses each of which possesses
its own basis of subsistence, and a corresponding mode
of labour, of needs, and of means for satisfying
them, besides of aims and interests, as well as of
mental culture and habit&mdash;constitutes the difference
of Estates (orders or ranks). Individuals apportion
themselves to these according to natural talent, skill,
option and accident. As belonging to such a definite
and stable sphere, they have their actual existence,
which as existence is essentially a particular; and in
it they have their social morality, which is <emph>honesty</emph>,
their recognition and their <emph>honour</emph>.
</p>

<p>
Where civil society, and with it the State, exists,
there arise the several estates in their difference: for
the universal substance, as vital, <emph>exists</emph> only so far as it
organically <emph>particularises</emph> itself. The history of constitutions
is the history of the growth of these estates,
of the legal relationships of individuals to them, and
of these estates to one another and to their centre.
</p>

<p>
<anchor id='Section_528'/>
§ 528. To the <q>substantial,</q> natural estate the fruitful
soil and ground supply a natural and stable capital;
its action gets direction and content through natural
features, and its moral life is founded on faith and
trust. The second, the <q>reflected</q> estate has as its
allotment the social capital, the medium created by the
action of middlemen, of mere agents, and an ensemble of
contingencies, where the individual has to depend on
his subjective skill, talent, intelligence and industry.
The third, <q>thinking</q> estate has for its business the
general interests; like the second it has a subsistence
procured by means of its own skill, and like the
first a certain subsistence, certain however because
guaranteed through the whole society.

<p>
<anchor id='Section_529'/>
§ 529. When matured through the operation of
natural need and free option into a system of universal
relationships and a regular course of external
necessity, the principle of casual particularity gets
that stable articulation which liberty requires in
the shape of <emph>formal right</emph>. (1) The actualisation
which right gets in this sphere of mere practical
intelligence is that it be brought to consciousness
as the stable universal, that it be known and stated
in its specificality with the voice of authority&mdash;the
<emph>Law</emph><note place='foot'><foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Geseß.</foreign></note>.
</p>

<p>
The <emph>positive</emph> element in laws concerns only their
form of <emph>publicity</emph> and <emph>authority</emph>&mdash;which makes it possible
for them to be known by all in a customary and external
way. Their content <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>per se</foreign> may be reasonable&mdash;or it
may be unreasonable and so wrong. But when right,
in the course of definite manifestation, is developed in
detail, and its content analyses itself to gain definiteness,
this analysis, because of the finitude of its materials,
falls into the falsely infinite progress: the <emph>final</emph> definiteness,
which is absolutely essential and causes a break
in this progress of unreality, can in this sphere of
finitude be attained only in a way that savours of contingency
and arbitrariness. Thus whether three years,
ten thalers, or only 2-1/2, 2-3/4, 2-4/5 years, and so on
<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>ad infinitum</foreign>, be the right and just thing, can by no
means be decided on intelligible principles,&mdash;and
yet it should be decided. Hence, though of course
only at the final points of deciding, on the side of
external existence, the <q>positive</q> principle naturally
enters law as contingency and arbitrariness. This
happens and has from of old happened in all legislations:
<pb n='126'/><anchor id='Pg126'/>
the only thing wanted is clearly to be aware of
it, and not be misled by the talk and the pretence as if
the ideal of law were, or could be, to be, at <emph>every</emph> point,
determined through reason or legal intelligence, on
purely reasonable and intelligent grounds. It is
a futile perfectionism to have such expectations and to
make such requirements in the sphere of the finite.
</p>

<p>
There are some who look upon laws as an evil and
a profanity, and who regard governing and being
governed from natural love, hereditary, divinity or
nobility, by faith and trust, as the genuine order of life,
while the reign of law is held an order of corruption
and injustice. These people forget that the stars&mdash;and
the cattle too&mdash;are governed and well governed too
by laws;&mdash;laws however which are only internally in
these objects, not <emph>for them</emph>, not as laws <emph>set to</emph> them:&mdash;whereas
it is man's privilege to <emph>know</emph> his law. They
forget therefore that he can truly obey only such known
law,&mdash;even as his law can only be a just law, as it is
a <emph>known</emph> law;&mdash;though in other respects it must be in
its essential content contingency and caprice, or at
least be mixed and polluted with such elements.
</p>

<p>
The same empty requirement of perfection is employed
for an opposite thesis&mdash;viz. to support the opinion that a
code is impossible or impracticable. In this case there
comes in the additional absurdity of putting essential
and universal provisions in one class with the particular
detail. The finite material is definable on and on to
the false infinite: but this advance is not, as in the
mental images of space, a generation of new spatial
characteristics of the same quality as those preceding
them, but an advance into greater and ever greater
speciality by the acumen of the analytic intellect, which
discovers new distinctions, which again make new
decisions necessary. To provisions of this sort one may
<pb n='127'/><anchor id='Pg127'/>
give the name of <emph>new</emph> decisions or <emph>new</emph> laws; but in
proportion to the gradual advance in specialisation the
interest and value of these provisions declines. They
fall within the already subsisting <q>substantial,</q> general
laws, like improvements on a floor or a door, within
the house&mdash;which though something <emph>new</emph>, are not a new
<emph>house</emph>. But there is a contrary case. If the legislation
of a rude age began with single provisos, which go on
by their very nature always increasing their number,
there arises, with the advance in multitude, the need of
a simpler code,&mdash;the need i.e. of embracing that lot of
singulars in their general features. To find and be able
to express these principles well beseems an intelligent
and civilised nation. Such a gathering up of single
rules into general forms, first really deserving the name
of laws, has lately been begun in some directions by the
English Minister Peel, who has by so doing gained the
gratitude, even the admiration, of his countrymen.
</p>

<p>
§ 530. (2) The positive form of Laws&mdash;to be <emph>promulgated
and made known</emph> as laws&mdash;is a condition of the <emph>external
obligation</emph> to obey them; inasmuch as, being laws of
strict right, they touch only the abstract will,&mdash;itself at
bottom external&mdash;not the moral or ethical will. The
subjectivity to which the will has in this direction a right
is here only publicity. This subjective existence is as
existence of the essential and developed truth in this
sphere of Right at the same time an externally objective
existence, as universal authority and necessity.
</p>

<p>
The legality of property and of private transactions
concerned therewith&mdash;in consideration of the principle
that all law must be promulgated, recognised, and thus
become authoritative&mdash;gets its universal guarantee
through <emph>formalities</emph>.
</p>

<p>
§ 531. (3) Legal forms get the necessity, to which
objective existence determines itself, in the <emph>judicial
<pb n='128'/><anchor id='Pg128'/>
system</emph>. Abstract right has to exhibit itself to the
<emph>court</emph>&mdash;to the individualised right&mdash;as <emph>proven</emph>:&mdash;a process
in which there may be a difference between what
is abstractly right and what is provably right. The
court takes cognisance and action in the interest of
right as such, deprives the existence of right of its
contingency, and in particular transforms this existence,&mdash;as
this exists as revenge&mdash;into <emph>punishment</emph> (§ <ref target='Section_500'>500</ref>).
</p>

<p>
The comparison of the two species, or rather two
elements in the judicial conviction, bearing on the actual
state of the case in relation to the accused,&mdash;(1) according
as that conviction is based on mere circumstances
and other people's witness alone,&mdash;or (2) in addition
requires the confession of the accused, constitutes the
main point in the question of the so-called jury-courts.
It is an essential point that the two ingredients of a
judicial cognisance, the judgment as to the state of the
fact, and the judgment as application of the law to it,
should, as at bottom different sides, be exercised as
<emph>different functions</emph>. By the said institution they are
allotted even to bodies differently qualified,&mdash;from the
one of which individuals belonging to the official
judiciary are expressly excluded. To carry this
separation of functions up to this separation in the
courts rests rather on extra-essential considerations: the
main point remains only the separate performance of
these essentially different functions.&mdash;It is a more
important point whether the confession of the accused is
or is not to be made a condition of penal judgment. The
institution of the jury-court loses sight of this condition.
The point is that on this ground certainty is completely
inseparable from truth: but the confession is to be
regarded as the very acmé of certainty-giving which
in its nature is subjective. The final decision therefore
lies with the confession. To this therefore the accused
<pb n='129'/><anchor id='Pg129'/>
has an absolute right, if the proof is to be made final and
the judges to be convinced. No doubt this factor is
incomplete, because it is only one factor; but still more
incomplete is the other when no less abstractly taken,&mdash;viz.
mere circumstantial evidence. The jurors are
essentially judges and pronounce a judgment. In so far,
then, as all they have to go on are such objective proofs,
whilst at the same time their defect of certainty
(incomplete in so far as it is only <emph>in them</emph>) is admitted,
the jury-court shows traces of its barbaric origin in a
confusion and admixture between objective proofs and
subjective or so-called <q>moral</q> conviction.&mdash;It is easy
to call <emph>extraordinary</emph> punishments an absurdity; but
the fault lies rather with the shallowness which takes
offence at a mere name. Materially the principle
involves the difference of objective probation according
as it goes with or without the factor of absolute
certification which lies in confession.
</p>

<p>
§ 532. The function of judicial administration is only
to actualise to necessity the abstract side of personal
liberty in civil society. But this actualisation rests at
first on the particular subjectivity of the judge, since
here as yet there is not found the necessary unity of it
with right in the abstract. Conversely, the blind
necessity of the system of wants is not lifted up into the
consciousness of the universal, and worked from that
period of view.

<p>
§ 533. Judicial administration naturally has no concern
with such part of actions and interests as belongs only to
particularity, and leaves to chance not only the occurrence
of crimes but also the care for public weal. In
civil society the sole end is to satisfy want&mdash;and that,
<pb n='130'/><anchor id='Pg130'/>
because it is man's want, in a uniform general way, so
as to <emph>secure</emph> this satisfaction. But the machinery of
social necessity leaves in many ways a casualness
about this satisfaction. This is due to the variability of
the wants themselves, in which opinion and subjective
good-pleasure play a great part. It results also from
circumstances of locality, from the connexions between
nation and nation, from errors and deceptions which
can be foisted upon single members of the social circulation
and are capable of creating disorder in it,&mdash;as also
and especially from the unequal capacity of individuals
to take advantage of that general stock. The onward
march of this necessity also sacrifices the very particularities
by which it is brought about, and does not itself
contain the affirmative aim of securing the satisfaction
of individuals. So far as concerns them, it <emph>may</emph> be
far from beneficial: yet here the individuals are the
morally-justifiable end.
</p>

<p>
<anchor id='Section_534'/>
§ 534. To keep in view this general end, to ascertain
the way in which the powers composing that social
necessity act, and their variable ingredients, and to
maintain that end in them and against them, is the
work of an institution which assumes on <emph>one</emph> hand,
to the concrete of civil society, the position of an
external universality. Such an order acts with the
power of an external state, which, in so far as it is
rooted in the higher or substantial state, appears as
state <q>police.</q> On the <emph>other</emph> hand, in this sphere of
particularity the only recognition of the aim of substantial
universality and the only carrying of it out is restricted
to the business of particular branches and interests.
Thus we have the <emph>corporation</emph>, in which the particular
citizen in his private capacity finds the securing of
his stock, whilst at the same time he in it emerges
from his single private interest, and has a conscious
<pb n='131'/><anchor id='Pg131'/>
activity for a comparatively universal end, just as in his
legal and professional duties he has his social morality.

<div>
<head>CC. The State.</head>

<p>
§ 535. The State is the <emph>self-conscious</emph> ethical substance,
the unification of the family principle with that of civil
society. The same unity, which is in the family as
a feeling of love, is its essence, receiving however at the
same time through the second principle of conscious
and spontaneously active volition the <emph>form</emph> of conscious
universality. This universal principle, with all its
evolution in detail, is the absolute aim and content of
the knowing subject, which thus identifies itself in its
volition with the system of reasonableness.
</p>

<p>
§ 536. The state is (α) its inward structure as a self-relating
development&mdash;constitutional (inner-state) law:
(β) a particular individual, and therefore in connexion
with other particular individuals,&mdash;international (outer-state)
law; (γ) but these particular minds are only
stages in the general development of mind in its
actuality: universal history.
</p>

<div>
<head>α. Constitutional Law<note place='foot'><foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Inneres Staatsrecht.</foreign></note>.</head>

<p>
§ 537. The essence of the state is the universal, self-originated
and self-developed,&mdash;the reasonable spirit of
will; but, as self-knowing and self-actualising, sheer subjectivity,
and&mdash;as an actuality&mdash;one individual. Its <emph>work</emph>
generally&mdash;in relation to the extreme of individuality as
the multitude of individuals&mdash;consists in a double function.
First it maintains them as persons, thus making
right a necessary actuality, then it promotes their welfare,
which each originally takes care of for himself, but
which has a thoroughly general side; it protects the
<pb n='132'/><anchor id='Pg132'/>
family and guides civil society. Secondly, it carries
back both, and the whole disposition and action of the
individual&mdash;whose tendency is to become a centre of
his own&mdash;into the life of the universal substance; and,
in this direction, as a free power it interferes with those
subordinate spheres and retains them in substantial
immanence.
</p>

<p>
§ 538. The laws express the special provisions for
objective freedom. First, to the immediate agent, his
independent self-will and particular interest, they are
restrictions. But, secondly, they are an absolute final
end and the universal work: hence they are a product
of the <q>functions</q> of the various orders which
parcel themselves more and more out of the general
particularising, and are a fruit of all the acts and
private concerns of individuals. Thirdly, they are the
substance of the volition of individuals&mdash;which volition
is thereby free&mdash;and of their disposition: being as such
exhibited as current usage.
</p>

<p>
§ 539. As a living mind, the state only is as an
organised whole, differentiated into particular agencies,
which, proceeding from the one notion (though not
known as notion) of the reasonable will, continually
produce it as their result. The <emph>constitution</emph> is this
articulation or organisation of state-power. It provides
for the reasonable will,&mdash;in so far as it is in the
individuals only <emph>implicitly</emph> the universal will,&mdash;coming
to a consciousness and an understanding of itself
and being <emph>found</emph>; also for that will being put in
actuality, through the action of the government and its
several branches, and not left to perish, but protected
both against <emph>their</emph> casual subjectivity and against that
of the individuals. The constitution is existent <emph>justice</emph>,&mdash;the
actuality of liberty in the development all its
reasonable provisions.
</p>

<pb n='133'/><anchor id='Pg133'/>

<p>
Liberty and Equality are the simple rubrics into
which is frequently concentrated what should form the
fundamental principle, the final aim and result of the
constitution. However true this is, the defect of these
terms is their utter abstractness: if stuck to in this
abstract form, they are principles which either prevent
the rise of the concreteness of the state, i.e. its articulation
into a constitution and a government in general,
or destroy them. With the state there arises inequality,
the difference of governing powers and of governed,
magistracies, authorities, directories, &amp;c. The principle
of equality, logically carried out, rejects all differences,
and thus allows no sort of political condition to exist.
Liberty and equality are indeed the foundation of the
state, but as the most abstract also the most superficial,
and for that very reason naturally the most familiar. It
is important therefore to study them closer.
</p>

<p>
As regards, first, Equality, the familiar proposition,
All men are by nature equal, blunders by confusing the
<q>natural</q> with the <q>notion.</q> It ought rather to read:
<emph>By nature</emph> men are only unequal. But the notion of
liberty, as it exists as such, without further specification
and development, is abstract subjectivity, as a person
capable of property (§ <ref target='Section_488'>488</ref>). This single abstract feature
of personality constitutes the actual <emph>equality</emph> of human
beings. But that this freedom should exist, that it
should be <emph>man</emph> (and not as in Greece, Rome, &amp;c. <emph>some</emph>
men) that is recognised and legally regarded as
a person, is so little <emph>by nature</emph>, that it is rather only
a result and product of the consciousness of the deepest
principle of mind, and of the universality and expansion
of this consciousness. That the citizens are equal
before the law contains a great truth, but which so
expressed is a tautology: it only states that the legal
status in general exists, that the laws rule. But, as
<pb n='134'/><anchor id='Pg134'/>
regards the concrete, the citizens&mdash;besides their
personality&mdash;are equal before the law only in these points
when they are otherwise equal <emph>outside the law</emph>. Only
that equality which (in whatever way it be) they, as
it happens, otherwise have in property, age, physical
strength, talent, skill, &amp;c.&mdash;or even in crime, can and
ought to make them deserve equal treatment before the
law:&mdash;only it can make them&mdash;as regards taxation, military
service, eligibility to office, &amp;c.&mdash;punishment, &amp;c.&mdash;equal
in the concrete. The laws themselves, except
in so far as they concern that narrow circle of personality,
presuppose unequal conditions, and provide for
the unequal legal duties and appurtenances resulting
therefrom.
</p>

<p>
As regards Liberty, it is originally taken partly in
a negative sense against arbitrary intolerance and lawless
treatment, partly in the affirmative sense of subjective
freedom; but this freedom is allowed great
latitude both as regards the agent's self-will and action
for his particular ends, and as regards his claim to
have a personal intelligence and a personal share in
general affairs. Formerly the legally defined rights,
private as well as public rights of a nation, town, &amp;c.
were called its <q>liberties.</q> Really, every genuine law
is a liberty: it contains a reasonable principle of
objective mind; in other words, it embodies a liberty.
Nothing has become, on the contrary, more familiar than
the idea that each must <emph>restrict</emph> his liberty in relation to
the liberty of others: that the state is a condition of
such reciprocal restriction, and that the laws are
restrictions. To such habits of mind liberty is viewed
as only casual good-pleasure and self-will. Hence it
has also been said that <q>modern</q> nations are only
susceptible of equality, or of equality more than liberty:
and that for no other reason than that, with an assumed
<pb n='135'/><anchor id='Pg135'/>
definition of liberty (chiefly the participation of all in
political affairs and actions), it was impossible to make
ends meet in actuality&mdash;which is at once more reasonable
and more powerful than abstract presuppositions.
On the contrary, it should be said that it is just the
great development and maturity of form in modern
states which produces the supreme concrete inequality
of individuals in actuality: while, through the deeper
reasonableness of laws and the greater stability of the
legal state, it gives rise to greater and more stable liberty,
which it can without incompatibility allow. Even the
superficial distinction of the words liberty and equality
points to the fact that the former tends to inequality:
whereas, on the contrary, the current notions of liberty
only carry us back to equality. But the more we fortify
liberty,&mdash;as security of property, as possibility for each
to develop and make the best of his talents and good
qualities, the more it gets taken for granted: and then
the sense and appreciation of liberty especially turns in
a <emph>subjective</emph> direction. By this is meant the liberty to
attempt action on every side, and to throw oneself at
pleasure in action for particular and for general
intellectual interests, the removal of all checks on the
individual particularity, as well as the inward liberty
in which the subject has principles, has an insight and
conviction of his own, and thus gains moral independence.
But this liberty itself on one hand implies that supreme
differentiation in which men are unequal and make
themselves more unequal by education; and on another
it only grows up under conditions of that objective
liberty, and is and could grow to such height only in
modern states. If, with this development of particularity,
there be simultaneous and endless increase of the
number of wants, and of the difficulty of satisfying them,
of the lust of argument and the fancy of detecting faults,
<pb n='136'/><anchor id='Pg136'/>
with its insatiate vanity, it is all but part of that indiscriminating
relaxation of individuality in this sphere
which generates all possible complications, and must
deal with them as it can. Such a sphere is of course
also the field of restrictions, because liberty is there
under the taint of natural self-will and self-pleasing, and
has therefore to restrict itself: and that, not merely with
regard to the naturalness, self-will and self-conceit,
of others, but especially and essentially with regard to
reasonable liberty.
</p>

<p>
The term political liberty, however, is often used to
mean formal participation in the public affairs of state
by the will and action even of those individuals who
otherwise find their chief function in the particular
aims and business of civil society. And it has in part
become usual to give the title constitution only to the
side of the state which concerns such participation of
these individuals in general affairs, and to regard
a state, in which this is not formally done, as a state
without a constitution. On this use of the term, the
only thing to remark is that by constitution must be
understood the determination of rights, i.e. of liberties
in general, and the organisation of the actualisation of
them; and that political freedom in the above sense can
in any case only constitute a part of it. Of it the
following paragraphs will speak.
</p>

<p>
§ 540. The guarantee of a constitution (i.e. the
necessity that the laws be reasonable, and their
actualisation secured) lies in the collective spirit of
the nation,&mdash;especially in the specific way in which
it is itself conscious of its reason. (Religion is that
consciousness in its absolute substantiality.) But the
guarantee lies also at the same time in the actual
organisation or development of that principle in suitable
institutions. The constitution presupposes that consciousness
<pb n='137'/><anchor id='Pg137'/>
of the collective spirit, and conversely that
spirit presupposes the constitution: for the actual spirit
only has a definite consciousness of its principles, in so
far as it has them actually existent before it.
</p>

<p>
The question&mdash;To whom (to what authority and how
organised) belongs the power to make a constitution? is
the same as the question, Who has to make the spirit of
a nation? Separate our idea of a constitution from that
of the collective spirit, as if the latter exists or has
existed without a constitution, and your fancy only
proves how superficially you have apprehended the
nexus between the spirit in its self-consciousness and
in its actuality. What is thus called <q>making</q> a
<q>constitution,</q> is&mdash;just because of this inseparability&mdash;a
thing that has never happened in history, just as
little as the making of a code of laws. A constitution
only develops from the national spirit identically with
that spirit's own development, and runs through at the
same time with it the grades of formation and the
alterations required by its concept. It is the indwelling
spirit and the history of the nation (and, be it added,
the history is only that spirit's history) by which constitutions
have been and are made.
</p>

<p>
§ 541. The really living totality,&mdash;that which preserves,
in other words continually produces the state in general
and its constitution, is the <emph>government</emph>. The organisation
which natural necessity gives is seen in the rise of the
family and of the 'estates' of civil society. The government
is the <emph>universal</emph> part of the constitution, i.e. the
part which intentionally aims at preserving those parts,
but at the same time gets hold of and carries out those
general aims of the whole which rise above the function
of the family and of civil society. The organisation of
the government is likewise its differentiation into powers,
as their peculiarities have a basis in principle; yet
<pb n='138'/><anchor id='Pg138'/>
without that difference losing touch with the <emph>actual unity</emph>
they have in the notion's subjectivity.
</p>

<p>
As the most obvious categories of the notion are those
of <emph>universality</emph> and <emph>individuality</emph> and their relationship
that of <emph>subsumption</emph> of individual under universal, it has
come about that in the state the legislative and executive
power have been so distinguished as to make the former
exist apart as the absolute superior, and to subdivide
the latter again into administrative (government) power
and judicial power, according as the laws are applied to
public or private affairs. The <emph>division</emph> of these powers
has been treated as <emph>the</emph> condition of political equilibrium,
meaning by division their <emph>independence</emph> one of another
in existence,&mdash;subject always however to the above-mentioned
subsumption of the powers of the individual
under the power of the general. The theory of such
<q>division</q> unmistakably implies the elements of the
notion, but so combined by <q>understanding</q> as to result
in an absurd collocation, instead of the self-redintegration
of the living spirit. The one essential canon to make
liberty deep and real is to give every business
belonging to the general interests of the state a separate
organisation wherever they are essentially distinct.
Such real division must be: for liberty is only deep
when it is differentiated in all its fullness and these
differences manifested in existence. But to make the
business of legislation an independent power&mdash;to make
it the first power, with the further proviso that all
citizens shall have part therein, and the government be
merely executive and dependent, presupposes ignorance
that the true idea, and therefore the living and spiritual
actuality, is the self-redintegrating notion, in other words,
the subjectivity which contains in it universality as only
one of its moments. (A mistake still greater, if it goes
with the fancy that the constitution and the fundamental
<pb n='139'/><anchor id='Pg139'/>
laws were still one day to make,&mdash;in a state of society,
which includes an already existing development of
differences.) Individuality is the first and supreme
principle <emph>which</emph> makes itself fall through the state's
organisation. Only through the government, and by its
embracing in itself the particular businesses (including
the abstract legislative business, which taken apart is
also particular), is the state <emph>one</emph>. These, as always, are
the terms on which the different elements essentially
and alone truly stand towards each other in the logic
of <q>reason,</q> as opposed to the external footing they
stand on in 'understanding,' which never gets beyond
subsuming the individual and particular under the
universal. What disorganises the unity of logical
reason, equally disorganises actuality.
</p>

<p>
§ 542. In the government&mdash;regarded as organic totality&mdash;the
sovereign power (principate) is (<hi rend='italic'>a</hi>) <emph>subjectivity</emph> as
the <emph>infinite</emph> self-unity of the notion in its development;&mdash;the
all-sustaining, all-decreeing will of the state, its
highest peak and all-pervasive unity. In the perfect
form of the state, in which each and every element of
the notion has reached free existence, this subjectivity
is not a so-called <q>moral person,</q> or a decree issuing
from a majority (forms in which the unity of the
decreeing will has not an <emph>actual</emph> existence), but an
actual individual,&mdash;the will of a decreeing individual,&mdash;<emph>monarchy</emph>.
The monarchical constitution is therefore
the constitution of developed reason: all other
constitutions belong to lower grades of the development
and realisation of reason.
</p>

<p>
The unification of all concrete state-powers into one
existence, as in the patriarchal society,&mdash;or, as in
a democratic constitution, the participation of all in all
affairs&mdash;impugns the principle of the division of powers,
i.e. the developed liberty of the constituent factors of
<pb n='140'/><anchor id='Pg140'/>
the Idea. But no whit less must the division (the
working out of these factors each to a free totality) be
reduced to <q>ideal</q> unity, i.e. to <emph>subjectivity</emph>. The mature
differentiation or realisation of the Idea means, essentially,
that this subjectivity should grow to be a <emph>real</emph>
<q>moment,</q> an <emph>actual</emph> existence; and this actuality is not
otherwise than as the individuality of the monarch&mdash;the
subjectivity of abstract and final decision existent in
<emph>one</emph> person. All those forms of collective decreeing and
willing,&mdash;a common will which shall be the sum and the
resultant (on aristocratical or democratical principles) of
the atomistic of single wills, have on them the mark of
the unreality of an abstraction. Two points only are
all-important, first to see the necessity of each of the
notional factors, and secondly the form in which it is
actualised. It is only the nature of the speculative
notion which can really give light on the matter. That
subjectivity&mdash;being the <q>moment</q> which emphasises the
need of abstract deciding in general&mdash;partly leads on to
the proviso that the name of the monarch appear as the
bond and sanction under which everything is done in
the government;&mdash;partly, being simple self-relation,
has attached to it the characteristic of <emph>immediacy</emph>, and
then of <emph>nature</emph>&mdash;whereby the destination of individuals
for the dignity of the princely power is fixed by inheritance.
</p>

<p>
§ 543. (<hi rend='italic'>b</hi>) In the <emph>particular</emph> government-power there
emerges, first, the division of state-business into its
branches (otherwise defined), legislative power, administration
of justice or judicial power, administration and
police, and its consequent distribution between particular
boards or offices, which having their business appointed
by law, to that end and for that reason, possess independence
of action, without at the same time ceasing to
stand under higher supervision. Secondly, too, there
<pb n='141'/><anchor id='Pg141'/>
arises the participation of <emph>several</emph> in state-business, who
together constitute the <q>general order</q> (§ <ref target='Section_528'>528</ref>) in so far
as they take on themselves the charge of universal ends
as the essential function of their particular life;&mdash;the
further condition for being able to take individually part
in this business being a certain training, aptitude, and
skill for such ends.
</p>

<p>
<anchor id='Section_544'/>
§ 544. The estates-collegium or provincial council is
an institution by which all such as belong to civil
society in general, and are to that degree private
persons, participate in the governmental power, especially
in legislation&mdash;viz. such legislation as concerns
the universal scope of those interests which do not, like
peace and war, involve the, as it were, personal interference
and action of the State as one man, and therefore
do not belong specially to the province of the
sovereign power. By virtue of this participation subjective
liberty and conceit, with their general opinion,
can show themselves palpably efficacious and enjoy the
satisfaction of feeling themselves to count for something.
</p>

<p>
The division of constitutions into democracy, aristocracy
and monarchy, is still the most definite statement
of their difference in relation to sovereignty. They
must at the same time be regarded as necessary
structures in the path of development,&mdash;in short, in
the history of the State. Hence it is superficial and
absurd to represent them as an object of <emph>choice</emph>. The
pure forms&mdash;necessary to the process of evolution&mdash;are,
in so far as they are finite and in course of change,
conjoined both with forms of their degeneration,&mdash;such
as ochlocracy, &amp;c., and with earlier transition-forms.
These two forms are not to be confused with those
legitimate structures. Thus, it may be&mdash;if we look only
to the fact that the will of one individual stands at
the head of the state&mdash;oriental despotism is included
<pb n='142'/><anchor id='Pg142'/>
under the vague name monarchy,&mdash;as also feudal
monarchy, to which indeed even the favourite name
of <q>constitutional monarchy</q> cannot be refused. The
true difference of these forms from genuine monarchy
depends on the true value of those principles of
right which are in vogue and have their actuality and
guarantee in the state-power. These principles are
those expounded earlier, liberty of property, and
above all personal liberty, civil society, with its industry
and its communities, and the regulated efficiency of the
particular bureaux in subordination to the laws.
</p>

<p>
The question which is most discussed is in what
sense we are to understand the participation of private
persons in state affairs. For it is as private persons
that the members of bodies of estates are primarily to
be taken, be they treated as mere individuals, or as
representatives of a number of people or of the nation.
The aggregate of private persons is often spoken of as
the <emph>nation</emph>: but as such an aggregate it is <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>vulgus</foreign>, not
<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>populus</foreign>: and in this direction, it is the one sole aim of
the state that a nation should <emph>not</emph> come to existence,
to power and action, <emph>as such an aggregate</emph>. Such a
condition of a nation is a condition of lawlessness,
demoralisation, brutishness: in it the nation would only
be a shapeless, wild, blind force, like that of the stormy,
elemental sea, which however is not self-destructive, as
the nation&mdash;a spiritual element&mdash;would be. Yet such
a condition may be often heard described as that of true
freedom. If there is to be any sense in embarking
upon the question of the participation of private persons
in public affairs, it is not a brutish mass, but an already
organised nation&mdash;one in which a governmental power
exists&mdash;which should be presupposed. The desirability
of such participation however is not to be put in the
superiority of particular intelligence, which private
<pb n='143'/><anchor id='Pg143'/>
persons are supposed to have over state officials&mdash;the
contrary may be the case&mdash;nor in the superiority of
their good will for the general best. The members of
civil society as such are rather people who find
their nearest duty in their private interest and (as
especially in the feudal society) in the interest of their
privileged corporation. Take the case of <emph>England</emph>
which, because private persons have a predominant
share in public affairs, has been regarded as having
the freest of all constitutions. Experience shows that
that country&mdash;as compared with the other civilised
states of Europe&mdash;is the most backward in civil and
criminal legislation, in the law and liberty of property,
in arrangements for art and science, and that objective
freedom or rational right is rather <emph>sacrificed</emph> to formal
right and particular private interest; and that this
happens even in the institutions and possessions
supposed to be dedicated to religion. The desirability
of private persons taking part in public affairs is partly
to be put in their concrete, and therefore more urgent,
sense of general wants. But the true motive is the
right of the collective spirit to appear as an <emph>externally
universal</emph> will, acting with orderly and express efficacy
for the public concerns. By this satisfaction of this
right it gets its own life quickened, and at the same time
breathes fresh life in the administrative officials; who
thus have it brought home to them that not merely have
they to enforce duties but also to have regard to rights.
Private citizens are in the state the incomparably
greater number, and form the multitude of such as are
recognised as persons. Hence the will-reason exhibits
its existence in them as a preponderating majority of
freemen, or in its <q>reflectional</q> universality, which has its
actuality vouchsafed it as a participation in the sovereignty.
But it has already been noted as a <q>moment</q>
<pb n='144'/><anchor id='Pg144'/>
of civil society (§§ <ref target='Section_527'>527</ref>, <ref target='Section_534'>534</ref>) that the individuals rise
from external into substantial universality, and form
a <emph>particular</emph> kind,&mdash;the Estates: and it is not in the
inorganic form of mere individuals as such (after the
<emph>democratic</emph> fashion of election), but as organic factors, as
estates, that they enter upon that participation. In the
state a power or agency must never appear and act as
a formless, inorganic shape, i.e. basing itself on the
principle of multeity and mere numbers.
</p>

<p>
Assemblies of Estates have been wrongly designated
as the <emph>legislative power</emph>, so far as they form only one
branch of that power,&mdash;a branch in which the special
government-officials have an <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>ex officio</foreign> share, while the
sovereign power has the privilege of final decision. In
a civilised state moreover legislation can only be a
further modification of existing law, and so-called new
laws can only deal with minutiae of detail and particularities
(cf. § <ref target='Section_529'>529</ref>, note), the main drift of which has been
already prepared or preliminarily settled by the practice
of the law-courts. The so-called <emph>financial law</emph>, in so far
as it requires the assent of the estates, is really a
government affair: it is only improperly called a law,
in the general sense of embracing a wide, indeed the
whole, range of the external means of government.
The finances deal with what in their nature are only
particular needs, ever newly recurring, even if they
touch on the sum total of such needs. If the main part
of the requirement were&mdash;as it very likely is&mdash;regarded
as permanent, the provision for it would have more the
nature of a law: but to be a law, it would have to be
made once for all, and not be made yearly, or every few
years, afresh. The part which varies according to time
and circumstances concerns in reality the smallest part
of the amount, and the provisions with regard to it have
even less the character of a law: and yet it is and may
<pb n='145'/><anchor id='Pg145'/>
be only this slight variable part which is matter of
dispute, and can be subjected to a varying yearly
estimate. It is this last then which falsely bears the
high-sounding name of the <q><emph>Grant</emph></q> of the <emph>Budget</emph>, i.e.
of the whole of the finances. A law for one year and
made each year has even to the plain man something
palpably absurd: for he distinguishes the essential and
developed universal, as content of a true law, from the
reflectional universality which only externally embraces
what in its nature is many. To give the name of a law
to the annual fixing of financial requirements only
serves&mdash;with the presupposed separation of legislative
from executive&mdash;to keep up the illusion of that
separation having real existence, and to conceal the
fact that the legislative power, when it makes a decree
about finance, is really engaged with strict executive
business. But the importance attached to the power
of from time to time granting <q>supply,</q> on the ground that
the assembly of estates possesses in it a <emph>check</emph> on the
government, and thus a guarantee against injustice
and violence,&mdash;this importance is in one way rather
plausible than real. The financial measures necessary
for the state's subsistence cannot be made conditional on
any other circumstances, nor can the state's subsistence
be put yearly in doubt. It would be a parallel absurdity
if the government were e.g. to grant and arrange the
judicial institutions always for a limited time merely;
and thus, by the threat of suspending the activity of such
an institution and the fear of a consequent state of
brigandage, reserve for itself a means of coercing
private individuals. Then again, the pictures of
a condition of affairs, in which it might be useful and
necessary to have in hand means of compulsion, are
partly based on the false conception of a contract
between rulers and ruled, and partly presuppose the
<pb n='146'/><anchor id='Pg146'/>
possibility of such a divergence in spirit between these
two parties as would make constitution and government
quite out of the question. If we suppose the empty
possibility of getting <emph>help</emph> by such compulsive means
brought into existence, such help would rather be the
derangement and dissolution of the state, in which
there would no longer be a government, but only
parties, and the violence and oppression of one party
would only be helped away by the other. To fit together
the several parts of the state into a constitution
after the fashion of mere understanding&mdash;i.e. to adjust
within it the machinery of a balance of powers external
to each other&mdash;is to contravene the fundamental idea of
what a state is.

<anchor id='Section_545'/>
§ 545. The final aspect of the state is to appear in immediate
actuality as a single nation marked by physical
conditions. As a single individual it is exclusive
against other like individuals. In their mutual relations,
waywardness and chance have a place; for each person
in the aggregate is autonomous: the universal of law is
only postulated between them, and not actually existent.
This independence of a central authority reduces
disputes between them to terms of mutual violence,
a <emph>state of war</emph>, to meet which the general estate in
the community assumes the particular function of
maintaining the state's independence against other
states, and becomes the estate of bravery.
</p>

<p>
§ 546. This state of war shows the omnipotence of
the state in its individuality&mdash;an individuality that goes
even to abstract negativity. Country and fatherland
then appear as the power by which the particular
independence of individuals and their absorption in the
external existence of possession and in natural life is
convicted of its own nullity,&mdash;as the power which procures
the maintenance of the general substance by the
<pb n='147'/><anchor id='Pg147'/>
patriotic sacrifice on the part of these individuals of this
natural and particular existence,&mdash;so making nugatory
the nugatoriness that confronts it.

§ 547. In the game of war the independence of States
is at stake. In one case the result may be the mutual
recognition of free national individualities (§ <ref target='Section_430'>430</ref>): and
by peace-conventions supposed to be for ever, both
this general recognition, and the special claims of nations
on one another, are settled and fixed. External state-rights
rest partly on these positive treaties, but to that
extent contain only rights falling short of true actuality
(§ <ref target='Section_545'>545</ref>): partly on so-called <emph>international</emph> law, the general
principle of which is its presupposed recognition by
the several States. It thus restricts their otherwise
unchecked action against one another in such a way
that the possibility of peace is left; and distinguishes
individuals as private persons (non-belligerents) from
the state. In general, international law rests on social
usage.

§ 548. As the mind of a special nation is actual
and its liberty is under natural conditions, it admits
on this nature-side the influence of geographical and
climatic qualities. It is in time; and as regards its
range and scope, has essentially a <emph>particular</emph> principle
on the lines of which it must run through a development
of its consciousness and its actuality. It has, in short,
a history of its own. But as a restricted mind its independence
is something secondary; it passes into universal
world-history, the events of which exhibit the dialectic
of the several national minds,&mdash;the judgment of the
world.

§ 549. This movement is the path of liberation for the
spiritual substance, the deed by which the absolute
final aim of the world is realised in it, and the merely
implicit mind achieves consciousness and self-consciousness.
It is thus the revelation and actuality of its
essential and completed essence, whereby it becomes
to the outward eye a universal spirit&mdash;a world-mind. As
this development is in time and in real existence, as it
is a history, its several stages and steps are the national
minds, each of which, as single and endued by nature
with a specific character, is appointed to occupy only
one grade, and accomplish one task in the whole deed.
</p>

<p>
The presupposition that history has an essential
and actual end, from the principles of which certain
characteristic results logically flow, is called an <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>a priori</foreign>
view of it, and philosophy is reproached with <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>a priori</foreign>
history-writing. On this point, and on history-writing
in general, this note must go into further detail.
That history, and above all universal history, is founded
on an essential and actual aim, which actually is and
will be realised in it&mdash;the plan of Providence; that, in
short, there is Reason in history, must be decided on
strictly philosophical ground, and thus shown to be
essentially and in fact necessary. To presuppose such
aim is blameworthy only when the assumed conceptions
or thoughts are arbitrarily adopted, and when a determined
attempt is made to force events and actions into
conformity with such conceptions. For such <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>a priori</foreign>
methods of treatment at the present day, however, those
are chiefly to blame who profess to be purely historical,
and who at the same time take opportunity expressly to
raise their voice against the habit of philosophising, first
in general, and then in history. Philosophy is to them
a troublesome neighbour: for it is an enemy of all
arbitrariness and hasty suggestions. Such <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>a priori</foreign>
<pb n='149'/><anchor id='Pg149'/>
history-writing has sometimes burst out in quarters
where one would least have expected it, especially on
the philological side, and in Germany more than in
France and England, where the art of historical writing
has gone through a process of purification to a firmer
and maturer character. Fictions, like that of a primitive
age and its primitive people, possessed from the
first of the true knowledge of God and all the sciences,&mdash;of
sacerdotal races,&mdash;and, when we come to minutiae,
of a Roman epic, supposed to be the source of the
legends which pass current for the history of ancient
Rome, &amp;c., have taken the place of the pragmatising
which detected psychological motives and associations.
There is a wide circle of persons who seem to consider
it incumbent on a <emph>learned</emph> and <emph>ingenious</emph> historian
drawing from the original sources to concoct such baseless
fancies, and form bold combinations of them from
a learned rubbish-heap of out-of-the-way and trivial facts,
in defiance of the best-accredited history.
</p>

<p>
Setting aside this subjective treatment of history, we
find what is properly the opposite view forbidding us
to import into history an <emph>objective purpose</emph>. This is after
all synonymous with what <emph>seems</emph> to be the still more
legitimate demand that the historian should proceed
with <emph>impartiality</emph>. This is a requirement often and
especially made on the <emph>history of philosophy</emph>: where it is
insisted there should be no prepossession in favour of
an idea or opinion, just as a judge should have no
special sympathy for one of the contending parties. In
the case of the judge it is at the same time assumed
that he would administer his office ill and foolishly, if
he had not an interest, and an exclusive interest in
justice, if he had not that for his aim and one sole aim,
or if he declined to judge at all. This requirement
which we may make upon the judge may be called
<pb n='150'/><anchor id='Pg150'/>
<emph>partiality</emph> for justice; and there is no difficulty here
in distinguishing it from <emph>subjective</emph> partiality. But in
speaking of the impartiality required from the historian,
this self-satisfied insipid chatter lets the distinction disappear,
and rejects both kinds of interest. It demands
that the historian shall bring with him no definite aim
and view by which he may sort out, state and criticise
events, but shall narrate them exactly in the casual
mode he finds them, in their incoherent and unintelligent
particularity. Now it is at least admitted that
a history must have an object, e.g. Rome and its fortunes,
or the Decline of the grandeur of the Roman
empire. But little reflection is needed to discover that
this is the presupposed end which lies at the basis of
the events themselves, as of the critical examination
into their comparative importance, i.e. their nearer or
more remote relation to it. A history without such aim
and such criticism would be only an imbecile mental
divagation, not as good as a fairy tale, for even children
expect a <foreign rend='italic'>motif</foreign> in their stories, a purpose at least
dimly surmiseable with which events and actions are
put in relation.
</p>

<p>
In the existence of a <emph>nation</emph> the substantial aim is to
be a state and preserve itself as such. A nation with
no state formation, (a <emph>mere nation</emph>), has strictly speaking
no history,&mdash;like the nations which existed before
the rise of states and others which still exist in a condition
of savagery. What happens to a nation, and takes
place within it, has its essential significance in relation
to the state: whereas the mere particularities of individuals
are at the greatest distance from the true object
of history. It is true that the general spirit of an age
leaves its imprint in the character of its celebrated
individuals, and even their particularities are but the
very distant and the dim media through which the
<pb n='151'/><anchor id='Pg151'/>
collective light still plays in fainter colours. Ay, even
such singularities as a petty occurrence, a word, express
not a subjective particularity, but an age, a nation,
a civilisation, in striking portraiture and brevity; and
to select such trifles shows the hand of a historian of
genius. But, on the other hand, the main mass of
singularities is a futile and useless mass, by the painstaking
accumulation of which the objects of real historical
value are overwhelmed and obscured. The essential
characteristic of the spirit and its age is always contained
in the great events. It was a correct instinct
which sought to banish such portraiture of the particular
and the gleaning of insignificant traits, into the <emph>Novel</emph>
(as in the celebrated romances of Walter Scott, &amp;c.).
Where the picture presents an unessential aspect of
life it is certainly in good taste to conjoin it with an
unessential material, such as the romance takes from
private events and subjective passions. But to take
the individual pettinesses of an age and of the persons
in it, and, in the interest of so-called truth, weave
them into the picture of general interests, is not only
against taste and judgment, but violates the principles
of objective truth. The only truth for mind is the
substantial and underlying essence, and not the
trivialities of external existence and contingency. It is
therefore completely indifferent whether such insignificancies
are duly vouched for by documents, or, as in the
romance, invented to suit the character and ascribed
to this or that name and circumstances.
</p>

<p>
The point of interest of <emph>Biography</emph>&mdash;to say a word
on that here&mdash;appears to run directly counter to any
universal scope and aim. But biography too has for its
background the historical world, with which the individual
is intimately bound up: even purely personal
originality, the freak of humour, &amp;c. suggests by allusion
<pb n='152'/><anchor id='Pg152'/>
that central reality and has its interest heightened by
the suggestion. The mere play of sentiment, on the
contrary, has another ground and interest than history.
</p>

<p>
The requirement of impartiality addressed to the
history of philosophy (and also, we may add, to the
history of religion, first in general, and secondly, to
church history) generally implies an even more decided
bar against presupposition of any objective aim. As the
State was already called the point to which in political
history criticism had to refer all events, so here the
<q><emph>Truth</emph></q> must be the object to which the several deeds
and events of the spirit would have to be referred.
What is actually done is rather to make the contrary
presupposition. Histories with such an object as
religion or philosophy are understood to have only
subjective aims for their theme, i.e. only opinions and
mere ideas, not an essential and realised object like the
truth. And that with the mere excuse that there is no
truth. On this assumption the sympathy with truth
appears as only a partiality of the usual sort,
a partiality for opinion and mere ideas, which all alike
have no stuff in them, and are all treated as indifferent.
In that way historical truth means but correctness&mdash;an
accurate report of externals, without critical treatment
save as regards this correctness&mdash;admitting, in this
case, only qualitative and quantitative judgments, no
judgments of necessity or notion (cf. notes to §§ 172 and
175). But, really, if Rome or the German empire,
&amp;c. are an actual and genuine object of political
history, and the aim to which the phenomena are to be
related and by which they are to be judged; then in
universal history the genuine spirit, the consciousness
of it and of its essence, is even in a higher degree
a true and actual object and theme, and an aim to
which all other phenomena are essentially and actually
<pb n='153'/><anchor id='Pg153'/>
subservient. Only therefore through their relationship
to it, i.e. through the judgment in which they are
subsumed under it, while it inheres in them, have they
their value and even their existence. It is the spirit
which not merely broods <emph>over</emph> history as over the waters,
but lives in it and is alone its principle of movement:
and in the path of that spirit, liberty, i.e. a development
determined by the notion of spirit, is the guiding
principle and only its notion its final aim, i.e. truth.
For Spirit is consciousness. Such a doctrine&mdash;or in
other words that Reason is in history&mdash;will be partly
at least a plausible faith, partly it is a cognition of
philosophy.

§ 550. This liberation of mind, in which it proceeds
to come to itself and to realise its truth, and the
business of so doing, is the supreme right, the absolute
Law. The self-consciousness of a particular nation is
a vehicle for the contemporary development of the
collective spirit in its actual existence: it is the objective
actuality in which that spirit for the time invests its
will. Against this absolute will the other particular
natural minds have no rights: <emph>that</emph> nation dominates
the world: but yet the universal will steps onward
over its property for the time being, as over a special
grade, and then delivers it over to its chance and doom.
</p>

<p>
§ 551. To such extent as this business of actuality
appears as an action, and therefore as a work of
<emph>individuals</emph>, these individuals, as regards the substantial
issue of their labour, are <emph>instruments</emph>, and their subjectivity,
which is what is peculiar to them, is the empty
form of activity. What they personally have gained
therefore through the individual share they took in the
substantial business (prepared and appointed independently
of them) is a formal universality or subjective
mental idea&mdash;<emph>Fame</emph>, which is their reward.

§ 552. The national spirit contains nature-necessity,
and stands in external existence (§ <ref target='Section_423'>423</ref>): the ethical
substance, potentially infinite, is actually a particular
and limited substance (§§ <ref target='Section_549'>549</ref>, <ref target='Section_450'>550</ref>); on its subjective
side it labours under contingency, in the shape of its
unreflective natural usages, and its content is presented
to it as something <emph>existing</emph> in time and tied to
an external nature and external world. The spirit,
however, (which <emph>thinks</emph> in this moral organism) overrides
and absorbs within itself the finitude attaching
to it as national spirit in its state and the state's temporal
interests, in the system of laws and usages. It
rises to apprehend itself in its essentiality. Such apprehension,
however, still has the immanent limitedness
of the national spirit. But the spirit which thinks in
universal history, stripping off at the same time those
limitations of the several national minds and its own
temporal restrictions, lays hold of its concrete universality,
and rises to apprehend the absolute mind, as
the eternally actual truth in which the contemplative
reason enjoys freedom, while the necessity of nature
and the necessity of history are only ministrant to its
revelation and the vessels of its honour.
</p>

<p>
The strictly technical aspects of the Mind's elevation
to God have been spoken of in the Introduction to the
Logic (cf. especially § 51, note). As regards the starting-point
of that elevation, Kant has on the whole adopted
the most correct, when he treats belief in God as
proceeding from the practical Reason. For that starting-point
contains the material or content which constitutes
the content of the notion of God. But the true concrete
material is neither Being (as in the cosmological) nor
mere action by design (as in the physico-theological
proof) but the Mind, the absolute characteristic and
function of which is effective reason, i.e. the self-determining
<pb n='155'/><anchor id='Pg155'/>
and self-realising notion itself,&mdash;Liberty.
That the elevation of subjective mind to God which
these considerations give is by Kant again deposed to
a <emph>postulate</emph>&mdash;a mere <q>ought</q>&mdash;is the peculiar perversity,
formerly noticed, of calmly and simply reinstating as
true and valid that very antithesis of finitude, the
supersession of which into truth is the essence of that
elevation.
</p>

<p>
As regards the <q>mediation</q> which, as it has been
already shown (§ 192, cf. § 204 note), that elevation to
God really involves, the point specially calling for note
is the <q>moment</q> of negation through which the essential
content of the starting-point is purged of its finitude so
as to come forth free. This factor, abstract in the
formal treatment of logic, now gets its most concrete
interpretation. The finite, from which the start is now
made, is the real ethical self-consciousness. The negation
through which that consciousness raises its spirit to
its truth, is the purification, <emph>actually</emph> accomplished in
the ethical world, whereby its conscience is purged of
subjective opinion and its will freed from the selfishness
of desire. Genuine religion and genuine religiosity
only issue from the moral life: religion is that life
rising to think, i.e. becoming aware of the free universality
of its concrete essence. Only from the moral
life and by the moral life is the Idea of God seen to be
free spirit: outside the ethical spirit therefore it is
vain to seek for true religion and religiosity.
</p>

<p>
But&mdash;as is the case with all speculative process&mdash;this
development of one thing out of another means
that what appears as sequel and derivative is rather
the absolute <foreign rend='italic'>prius</foreign> of what it appears to be mediated
by, and what is here in mind known as its truth.
</p>

<p>
Here then is the place to go more deeply into the
reciprocal relations between the state and religion, and
<pb n='156'/><anchor id='Pg156'/>
in doing so to elucidate the terminology which is
familiar and current on the topic. It is evident and
apparent from what has preceded that moral life is
the state retracted into its inner heart and substance,
while the state is the organisation and actualisation of
moral life; and that religion is the very substance of
the moral life itself and of the state. At this rate, the
state rests on the ethical sentiment, and that on the
religious. If religion then is the consciousness of
<emph><q>absolute</q> truth</emph>, then whatever is to rank as right and
justice, as law and duty, i.e. as <emph>true</emph> in the world of free
will, can be so esteemed only as it is participant in that
truth, as it is subsumed under it and is its sequel. But
if the truly moral life is to be a sequel of religion, then
perforce religion must have the <emph>genuine</emph> content; i.e. the
idea of God it knows must be the true and real. The
ethical life is the divine spirit as indwelling in self-consciousness,
as it is actually present in a nation and
its individual members. This self-consciousness retiring
upon itself out of its empirical actuality and bringing
its truth to consciousness, has in its <emph>faith</emph> and in its
<emph>conscience</emph> only what it has consciously secured in
its spiritual actuality. The two are inseparable: there
cannot be two kinds of conscience, one religious and
another ethical, differing from the former in body and
value of truth. But in point of form, i.e. for thought
and knowledge&mdash;(and religion and ethical life belong to
intelligence and are a thinking and knowing)&mdash;the body
of religious truth, as the pure self-subsisting and therefore
supreme truth, exercises a sanction over the moral
life which lies in empirical actuality. Thus for self-consciousness
religion is the <q>basis</q> of moral life and
of the state. It has been the monstrous blunder of
our times to try to look upon these inseparables as
separable from one another, and even as mutually
<pb n='157'/><anchor id='Pg157'/>
indifferent. The view taken of the relationship of
religion and the state has been that, whereas the state
had an independent existence of its own, springing from
some force and power, religion was a later addition, something
desirable perhaps for strengthening the political
bulwarks, but purely subjective in individuals:&mdash;or it
may be, religion is treated as something without effect on
the moral life of the state, i.e. its reasonable law and
constitution which are based on a ground of their own.
</p>

<p>
As the inseparability of the two sides has been indicated,
it may be worth while to note the separation
as it appears on the side of religion. It is primarily
a point of form: the attitude which self-consciousness
takes to the body of truth. So long as this body of
truth is the very substance or indwelling spirit of self-consciousness
in its actuality, then self-consciousness
in this content has the certainty of itself and is free.
But if this present self-consciousness is lacking, then
there may be created, in point of form, a condition of
spiritual slavery, even though the <emph>implicit</emph> content of
religion is absolute spirit. This great difference (to
cite a specific case) comes out within the Christian
religion itself, even though here it is not the nature-element
in which the idea of God is embodied, and
though nothing of the sort even enters as a factor into
its central dogma and sole theme of a God who is
known in spirit and in truth. And yet in Catholicism
this spirit of all truth is in actuality set in rigid opposition
to the self-conscious spirit. And, first of all, God is
in the <q>host</q> presented to religious adoration as an
<emph>external thing</emph>. (In the Lutheran Church, on the contrary,
the host as such is not at first consecrated, but in
the moment of enjoyment, i.e. in the annihilation of its
externality, and in the act of faith, i.e. in the free self-certain
spirit: only then is it consecrated and exalted
<pb n='158'/><anchor id='Pg158'/>
to be present God.) From that first and supreme status
of externalisation flows every other phase of externality,&mdash;of
bondage, non-spirituality, and superstition. It
leads to a laity, receiving its knowledge of divine
truth, as well as the direction of its will and conscience
from without and from another order&mdash;which order
again does not get possession of that knowledge in
a spiritual way only, but to that end essentially requires
an external consecration. It leads to the non-spiritual
style of praying&mdash;partly as mere moving of the lips,
partly in the way that the subject foregoes his right of
directly addressing God, and prays others to pray&mdash;addressing
his devotion to miracle-working images,
even to bones, and expecting miracles from them.
It leads, generally, to justification by external works,
a merit which is supposed to be gained by acts, and
even to be capable of being transferred to others. All
this binds the spirit under an externalism by which the
very meaning of spirit is perverted and misconceived at
its source, and law and justice, morality and conscience,
responsibility and duty are corrupted at their root.
</p>

<p>
Along with this principle of spiritual bondage, and
these applications of it in the religious life, there can
only go in the legislative and constitutional system
a legal and moral bondage, and a state of lawlessness
and immorality in political life. Catholicism has been
loudly praised and is still often praised&mdash;logically
enough&mdash;as the one religion which secures the stability
of governments. But in reality this applies only to
governments which are bound up with institutions
founded on the bondage of the spirit (of that spirit
which should have legal and moral liberty), i.e. with
institutions that embody injustice and with a morally
corrupt and barbaric state of society. But these
governments are not aware that in fanaticism they
<pb n='159'/><anchor id='Pg159'/>
have a terrible power, which does not rise in hostility
against them, only so long as and only on condition that
they remain sunk in the thraldom of injustice and
immorality. But in mind there is a very different
power available against that externalism and dismemberment
induced by a false religion. Mind collects
itself into its inward free actuality. Philosophy
awakes in the spirit of governments and nations the
wisdom to discern what is essentially and actually right
and reasonable in the real world. It was well to call
these products of thought, and in a special sense
Philosophy, the wisdom of the world<note place='foot'><foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Weltweisheit.</foreign></note>; for thought
makes the spirit's truth an actual present, leads it into
the real world, and thus liberates it in its actuality
and in its own self.
</p>

<p>
Thus set free, the content of religion assumes quite
another shape. So long as the form, i.e. our consciousness
and subjectivity, lacked liberty, it followed necessarily
that self-consciousness was conceived as not
immanent in the ethical principles which religion
embodies, and these principles were set at such a distance
as to seem to have true being only as negative to actual
self-consciousness. In this unreality ethical content
gets the name of <emph>Holiness</emph>. But once the divine spirit
introduces itself into actuality, and actuality emancipates
itself to spirit, then what in the world was a postulate of
holiness is supplanted by the actuality of <emph>moral</emph> life.
Instead of the vow of chastity, <emph>marriage</emph> now ranks as
the ethical relation; and, therefore, as the highest on
this side of humanity stands the family. Instead of the
vow of poverty (muddled up into a contradiction of
assigning merit to whosoever gives away goods to the
poor, i.e. whosoever enriches them) is the precept of
action to acquire goods through one's own intelligence
<pb n='160'/><anchor id='Pg160'/>
and industry,&mdash;of honesty in commercial dealing, and in
the use of property,&mdash;in short moral life in the socio-economic
sphere. And instead of the vow of obedience,
true religion sanctions obedience to the law and the legal
arrangements of the state&mdash;an obedience which is itself
the true freedom, because the state is a self-possessed,
self-realising reason&mdash;in short, moral life in the state.
Thus, and thus only, can law and morality exist. The
precept of religion, <q>Give to Caesar what is Caesar's
and to God what is God's</q> is not enough: the question
is to settle what is Caesar's, what belongs to the secular
authority: and it is sufficiently notorious that the
secular no less than the ecclesiastical authority have
claimed almost everything as their own. The divine
spirit must interpenetrate the entire secular life:
whereby wisdom is concrete within it, and it carries the
terms of its own justification. But that concrete
indwelling is only the aforesaid ethical organisations.
It is the morality of marriage as against the sanctity
of a celibate order;&mdash;the morality of economic and
industrial action against the sanctity of poverty and
its indolence;&mdash;the morality of an obedience dedicated
to the law of the state as against the sanctity
of an obedience from which law and duty are absent
and where conscience is enslaved. With the growing
need for law and morality and the sense of the
spirit's essential liberty, there sets in a conflict of
spirit with the religion of unfreedom. It is no
use to organise political laws and arrangements on
principles of equity and reason, so long as in religion
the principle of unfreedom is not abandoned. A free
state and a slavish religion are incompatible. It is silly
to suppose that we may try to allot them separate
spheres, under the impression that their diverse natures
will maintain an attitude of tranquillity one to another
<pb n='161'/><anchor id='Pg161'/>
and not break out in contradiction and battle. Principles
of civil freedom can be but abstract and superficial,
and political institutions deduced from them must be, if
taken alone, untenable, so long as those principles in
their wisdom mistake religion so much as not to know
that the maxims of the reason in actuality have their
last and supreme sanction in the religious conscience
in subsumption under the consciousness of <q>absolute</q>
truth. Let us suppose even that, no matter how, a code
of law should arise, so to speak <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>a priori</foreign>, founded on
principles of reason, but in contradiction with an established
religion based on principles of spiritual unfreedom;
still, as the duty of carrying out the laws lies in
the hands of individual members of the government,
and of the various classes of the administrative <emph>personnel</emph>,
it is vain to delude ourselves with the abstract
and empty assumption that the individuals will act only
according to the letter or meaning of the law, and not
in the spirit of their religion where their inmost conscience
and supreme obligation lies. Opposed to what
religion pronounces holy, the laws appear something
made by human hands: even though backed by penalties
and externally introduced, they could offer no lasting
resistance to the contradiction and attacks of the religious
spirit. Such laws, however sound their provisions may
be, thus founder on the conscience, whose spirit is
different from the spirit of the laws and refuses to
sanction them. It is nothing but a modern folly to try
to alter a corrupt moral organisation by altering its
political constitution and code of laws without changing
the religion,&mdash;to make a revolution without having
made a reformation, to suppose that a political constitution
opposed to the old religion could live in peace and
harmony with it and its sanctities, and that stability
could be procured for the laws by external guarantees,
<pb n='162'/><anchor id='Pg162'/>
e.g. so-called <q>chambers,</q> and the power given them to
fix the budget, &amp;c. (cf. § <ref target='Section_544'>544</ref> note). At best it is only
a temporary expedient&mdash;when it is obviously too great
a task to descend into the depths of the religious spirit
and to raise that same spirit to its truth&mdash;to seek to
separate law and justice from religion. Those guarantees
are but rotten bulwarks against the consciences of
the persons charged with administering the laws&mdash;among
which laws these guarantees are included. It
is indeed the height and profanity of contradiction
to seek to bind and subject to the secular code the
religious conscience to which mere human law is
a thing profane.
</p>

<p>
The perception had dawned upon Plato with great
clearness of the gulf which in his day had commenced
to divide the established religion and the political constitution,
on one hand, from those deeper requirements
which, on the other hand, were made upon religion and
politics by liberty which had learnt to recognise its
inner life. Plato gets hold of the thought that a genuine
constitution and a sound political life have their deeper
foundation on the Idea,&mdash;on the essentially and actually
universal and genuine principles of eternal righteousness.
Now to see and ascertain what these are is
certainly the function and the business of <emph>philosophy</emph>.
It is from this point of view that Plato breaks out into
the celebrated or notorious passage where he makes
Socrates emphatically state that philosophy and political
power must coincide, that the Idea must be regent, if
the distress of nations is to see its end. What Plato
thus definitely set before his mind was that the Idea&mdash;which
implicitly indeed is the free self-determining
thought&mdash;could not get into consciousness save only in
the form of a thought; that the substance of the thought
could only be true when set forth as a universal, and
<pb n='163'/><anchor id='Pg163'/>
as such brought to consciousness under its most
abstract form.
</p>

<p>
To compare the Platonic standpoint in all its definiteness
with the point of view from which the relationship
of state and religion is here regarded, the notional
differences on which everything turns must be recalled
to mind. The first of these is that in natural things
their substance or genus is different from their existence
in which that substance is as subject: further that this
subjective existence of the genus is distinct from that
which it gets, when specially set in relief as genus, or,
to put it simply, as the universal in a mental concept
or idea. This additional <q>individuality</q>&mdash;the soil on
which the universal and underlying principle <emph>freely</emph> and
expressly exists,&mdash;is the intellectual and thinking <emph>self</emph>.
In the case of <emph>natural</emph> things their truth and reality does
not get the form of universality and essentiality through
themselves, and their <q>individuality</q> is not itself the
form: the form is only found in subjective thinking,
which in philosophy gives that universal truth and reality
an existence of its own. In man's case it is otherwise:
his truth and reality is the free mind itself, and
it comes to existence in his self-consciousness. This
absolute nucleus of man&mdash;mind intrinsically concrete&mdash;is
just this&mdash;to have the form (to have thinking) itself
for a content. To the height of the thinking consciousness
of this principle Aristotle ascended in his notion
of the entelechy of thought, (which is νοῆσις τῆς νοήσεως),
thus surmounting the Platonic Idea (the genus, or
essential being). But thought always&mdash;and that on
account of this very principle&mdash;contains the immediate
self-subsistence of subjectivity no less than it contains
universality; the genuine Idea of the intrinsically
concrete mind is just as essentially under the one of its
terms (subjective consciousness) as under the other
<pb n='164'/><anchor id='Pg164'/>
(universality): and in the one as in the other it is the
same substantial content. Under the subjective form,
however, fall feeling, intuition, pictorial representation:
and it is in fact necessary that in point of time the
consciousness of the absolute Idea should be first
reached and apprehended in this form: in other words,
it must exist in its immediate reality as religion,
earlier than it does as philosophy. Philosophy is
a later development from this basis (just as Greek
philosophy itself is later than Greek religion), and in
fact reaches its completion by catching and comprehending
in all its definite essentiality that principle of spirit
which first manifests itself in religion. But Greek
philosophy could set itself up only in opposition to
Greek religion: the unity of thought and the substantiality
of the Idea could take up none but a hostile
attitude to an imaginative polytheism, and to the
gladsome and frivolous humours of its poetic creations.
The <emph>form</emph> in its infinite truth, the <emph>subjectivity</emph> of mind,
broke forth at first only as a subjective free <emph>thinking</emph>,
which was not yet identical with the <emph>substantiality</emph>
itself,&mdash;and thus this underlying principle was not yet
apprehended as <emph>absolute mind</emph>. Thus religion might
appear as first purified only through philosophy,&mdash;through
pure self-existent thought: but the form pervading
this underlying principle&mdash;the form which
philosophy attacked&mdash;was that creative imagination.
</p>

<p>
Political power, which is developed similarly, but
earlier than philosophy, from religion, exhibits the
onesidedness, which in the actual world may infect
its <emph>implicitly</emph> true Idea, as demoralisation. Plato, in
common with all his thinking contemporaries, perceived
this demoralisation of democracy and the defectiveness
even of its principle; he set in relief accordingly the
underlying principle of the state, but could not work
<pb n='165'/><anchor id='Pg165'/>
into his idea of it the infinite form of subjectivity, which
still escaped his intelligence. His state is therefore, on
its own showing, wanting in subjective liberty (§ <ref target='Section_503'>503</ref> note,
§ <ref target='Section_513'>513</ref>, &amp;c.). The truth which should be immanent in the
state, should knit it together and control it, he, for these
reasons, got hold of only the form of thought-out truth,
of philosophy; and hence he makes that utterance that
<q>so long as philosophers do not rule in the states, or
those who are now called kings and rulers do not
soundly and comprehensively philosophise, so long
neither the state nor the race of men can be liberated
from evils,&mdash;so long will the idea of the political constitution
fall short of possibility and not see the light of
the sun.</q> It was not vouchsafed to Plato to go on so
far as to say that so long as true religion did not spring
up in the world and hold sway in political life, so long
the genuine principle of the state had not come into
actuality. But so long too this principle could not
emerge even in thought, nor could thought lay hold of
the genuine idea of the state,&mdash;the idea of the substantial
moral life, with which is identical the liberty of an
independent self-consciousness. Only in the principle
of mind, which is aware of its own essence, is implicitly
in absolute liberty, and has its actuality in the act of
self-liberation, does the absolute possibility and necessity
exist for political power, religion, and the principles of
philosophy coinciding in one, and for accomplishing the
reconciliation of actuality in general with the mind, of the
state with the religious conscience as well as with the
philosophical consciousness. Self-realising subjectivity
is in this case absolutely identical with substantial
universality. Hence religion as such, and the state as
such,&mdash;both as forms in which the principle exists&mdash;each
contain the absolute truth: so that the truth, in its
philosophic phase, is after all only in one of its forms.
<pb n='166'/><anchor id='Pg166'/>
But even religion, as it grows and expands, lets other
aspects of the Idea of humanity grow and expand
also (§ <ref target='Section_500'>500</ref> sqq.). As it is left therefore behind,
in its first immediate, and so also one-sided phase,
Religion may, or rather <emph>must</emph>, appear in its existence
degraded to sensuous externality, and thus in the
sequel become an influence to oppress liberty of spirit
and to deprave political life. Still the principle has in
it the infinite <q>elasticity</q> of the <q>absolute</q> form, so as
to overcome this depraving of the form-determination
(and of the content by these means), and to bring about
the reconciliation of the spirit in itself. Thus ultimately,
in the Protestant conscience the principles of the
religious and of the ethical conscience come to be one
and the same: the free spirit learning to see itself in
its reasonableness and truth. In the Protestant state,
the constitution and the code, as well as their several
applications, embody the principle and the development
of the moral life, which proceeds and can only proceed
from the truth of religion, when reinstated in its
original principle and in that way as such first become
actual. The moral life of the state and the religious
spirituality of the state are thus reciprocal guarantees
of strength.

§ 553. The <emph>notion</emph> of mind has its <emph>reality</emph> in the mind.
If this reality in identity with that notion is to exist as
the consciousness of the absolute Idea, then the necessary
aspect is that the <emph>implicitly</emph> free intelligence be in
its actuality liberated to its notion, if that actuality is to
be a vehicle worthy of it. The subjective and the
objective spirit are to be looked on as the road on
which this aspect of <emph>reality</emph> or existence rises to
maturity.
</p>

<p>
§ 554. The absolute mind, while it is self-centred
<emph>identity</emph>, is always also identity returning and ever
returned into itself: if it is the one and universal
<emph>substance</emph> it is so as a spirit, discerning itself into
a self and a consciousness, for which it is as substance.
<emph>Religion</emph>, as this supreme sphere may be in
general designated, if it has on one hand to be studied
as issuing from the subject and having its home in the
subject, must no less be regarded as objectively issuing
from the absolute spirit which as spirit is in its community.

<p>
That here, as always, belief or faith is not opposite
<pb n='168'/><anchor id='Pg168'/>
to consciousness or knowledge, but rather to a sort of
knowledge, and that belief is only a particular form of
the latter, has been remarked already (§ 63 note). If
nowadays there is so little consciousness of God,
and his objective essence is so little dwelt upon, while
people speak so much more of the subjective side of
religion, i.e. of God's indwelling in us, and if that and
not the truth as such is called for,&mdash;in this there is at
least the correct principle that God must be apprehended
as spirit in his community.
</p>

<p>
§ 555. The subjective consciousness of the absolute
spirit is essentially and intrinsically a process, the
immediate and substantial unity of which is the <emph>Belief</emph>
in the witness of the spirit as the <emph>certainty</emph> of objective
truth. Belief, at once this immediate unity and containing
it as a reciprocal dependence of these different
terms, has in <emph>devotion</emph>&mdash;the implicit or more explicit act
of worship (<foreign rend='italic'>cultus</foreign>)&mdash;passed over into the process of
superseding the contrast till it becomes spiritual liberation,
the process of authenticating that first certainty by
this intermediation, and of gaining its concrete determination,
viz. reconciliation, the actuality of the spirit.

<p>
<anchor id='Section_556'/>
§ 556. As this consciousness of the Absolute first takes
shape, its immediacy produces the factor of finitude in
Art. On one hand that is, it breaks up into a work of
external common existence, into the subject which produces
that work, and the subject which contemplates and
worships it. But, on the other hand, it is the concrete
<emph>contemplation</emph> and mental picture of implicitly absolute
spirit as the <emph>Ideal</emph>. In this ideal, or the concrete shape
born of the subjective spirit, its natural immediacy,
which is only a <emph>sign</emph> of the Idea, is so transfigured by
the informing spirit in order to express the Idea, that
the figure shows it and it alone:&mdash;the shape or form of
<emph>Beauty</emph>.
</p>

<p>
§ 557. The sensuous externality attaching to the beautiful,&mdash;the
<emph>form of immediacy</emph> as such,&mdash;at the same time
<emph>qualifies</emph> what it <emph>embodies</emph>: and the God (of art) has with
his spirituality at the same time the stamp upon him of
a natural medium or natural phase of existence&mdash;He
contains the so-called <emph>unity</emph> of nature and spirit&mdash;i.e.
the immediate unity in sensuously intuitional form&mdash;hence
not the spiritual unity, in which the natural would
be put only as <q>ideal,</q> as superseded in spirit, and the
spiritual content would be only in self-relation. It is
not the absolute spirit which enters this consciousness.
On the subjective side the community has of course an
<pb n='170'/><anchor id='Pg170'/>
ethical life, aware, as it is, of the spirituality of its
essence: and its self-consciousness and actuality are
in it elevated to substantial liberty. But with the
stigma of immediacy upon it, the subject's liberty is
only a <emph>manner of life</emph>, without the infinite self-reflection
and the subjective inwardness of <emph>conscience</emph>. These
considerations govern in their further developments the
devotion and the worship in the religion of fine art.
</p>

<p>
§ 558. For the objects of contemplation it has to
produce, Art requires not only an external given
material&mdash;(under which are also included subjective
images and ideas), but&mdash;for the expression of spiritual
truth&mdash;must use the given forms of nature with a significance
which art must divine and possess (cf. § <ref target='Section_411'>411</ref>). Of
all such forms the human is the highest and the true,
because only in it can the spirit have its corporeity
and thus its visible expression.
</p>

<p>
This disposes of the principle of the <emph>imitation of
nature</emph> in art: a point on which it is impossible to come
to an understanding while a distinction is left thus
abstract,&mdash;in other words, so long as the natural is only
taken in its externality, not as the <q>characteristic</q>
meaningful nature-form which is significant of spirit.
</p>

<p>
§ 559. In such single shapes the <q>absolute</q> mind
cannot be made explicit: in and to art therefore the
spirit is a limited natural spirit whose implicit universality,
when steps are taken to specify its fullness in
detail, breaks up into an indeterminate polytheism.
With the essential restrictedness of its content, Beauty
in general goes no further than a penetration of the vision
or image by the spiritual principle,&mdash;something formal,
so that the thought embodied, or the idea, can, like the
material which it uses to work in, be of the most diverse
and unessential kind, and still the work be something
beautiful and a work of art.
</p>

<pb n='171'/><anchor id='Pg171'/>

<p>
§ 560. The one-sidedness of <emph>immediacy</emph> on the part of the
Ideal involves the opposite one-sidedness (§ <ref target='Section_556'>556</ref>) that it
is something <emph>made</emph> by the artist. The subject or agent
is the mere technical activity: and the work of art is
only then an expression of the God, when there is no
sign of subjective particularity in it, and the net power
of the indwelling spirit is conceived and born into the
world, without admixture and unspotted from its contingency.
But as liberty only goes as far as there is
thought, the action inspired with the fullness of this
indwelling power, the artist's <emph>enthusiasm</emph>, is like a foreign
force under which he is bound and passive; the artistic
<emph>production</emph> has on its part the form of natural immediacy,
it belongs to the <emph>genius</emph> or particular endowment of the
artist,&mdash;and is at the same time a labour concerned with
technical cleverness and mechanical externalities. The
work of art therefore is just as much a work due to free
option, and the artist is the master of the God.
</p>

<p>
§ 561. In work so inspired the reconciliation appears
so obvious in its initial stage that it is without more ado
accomplished in the subjective self-consciousness, which
is thus self-confident and of good cheer, without the
depth and without the sense of its antithesis to the
absolute essence. On the further side of the perfection
(which is reached in such reconciliation, in the beauty
of <emph>classical art</emph>) lies the art of sublimity,&mdash;<emph>symbolic art</emph>,
in which the figuration suitable to the Idea is not yet
found, and the thought as going forth and wrestling
with the figure is exhibited as a negative attitude to
it, and yet all the while toiling to work itself into it.
The meaning or theme thus shows it has not yet
reached the infinite form, is not yet known, not yet
conscious of itself, as free spirit. The artist's theme
only is as the abstract God of pure thought, or an effort
towards him,&mdash;a restless and unappeased effort which
<pb n='172'/><anchor id='Pg172'/>
throws itself into shape after shape as it vainly tries to
find its goal.
</p>

<p>
§ 562. In another way the Idea and the sensuous
figure it appears in are incompatible; and that is where
the infinite form, subjectivity, is not as in the first
extreme a mere superficial personality, but its inmost
depth, and God is known not as only seeking his form
or satisfying himself in an external form, but as only
finding himself in himself, and thus giving himself his
adequate figure in the spiritual world alone. <emph>Romantic
art</emph> gives up the task of showing him as such in external
form and by means of beauty: it presents him as only
condescending to appearance, and the divine as the
heart of hearts in an externality from which it always
disengages itself. Thus the external can here appear
as contingent towards its significance.
</p>

<p>
The Philosophy of Religion has to discover the logical
necessity in the progress by which the Being, known
as the Absolute, assumes fuller and firmer features;
it has to note to what particular feature the kind of
cultus corresponds,&mdash;and then to see how the secular
self-consciousness, the consciousness of what is the
supreme vocation of man,&mdash;in short how the nature of a
nation's moral life, the principle of its law, of its actual
liberty, and of its constitution, as well as of its art and
science, corresponds to the principle which constitutes
the substance of a religion. That all these elements of
a nation's actuality constitute one systematic totality,
that one spirit creates and informs them, is a truth on
which follows the further truth that the history of
religions coincides with the world-history.
</p>

<p>
As regards the close connexion of art with the various
religions it may be specially noted that <emph>beautiful</emph> art can
only belong to those religions in which the spiritual
principle, though concrete and intrinsically free, is not
<pb n='173'/><anchor id='Pg173'/>
yet absolute. In religions where the Idea has not yet
been revealed and known in its free character, though
the craving for art is felt in order to bring in imaginative
visibility to consciousness the idea of the supreme being,
and though art is the sole organ in which the abstract
and radically indistinct content,&mdash;a mixture from natural
and spiritual sources,&mdash;can try to bring itself to consciousness;&mdash;still
this art is defective; its form is
defective because its subject-matter and theme is so,&mdash;for
the defect in subject-matter comes from the form not
being immanent in it. The representations of this
symbolic art keep a certain tastelessness and stolidity&mdash;for
the principle it embodies is itself stolid and dull, and
hence has not the power freely to transmute the external
to significance and shape. Beautiful art, on the contrary,
has for its condition the self-consciousness of the free
spirit,&mdash;the consciousness that compared with it the
natural and sensuous has no standing of its own: it
makes the natural wholly into the mere expression of
spirit, which is thus the inner form that gives utterance
to itself alone.
</p>

<p>
But with a further and deeper study, we see that
the advent of art, in a religion still in the bonds of
sensuous externality, shows that such religion is on the
decline. At the very time it seems to give religion the
supreme glorification, expression and brilliancy, it has
lifted the religion away over its limitation. In the
sublime divinity to which the work of art succeeds in
giving expression the artistic genius and the spectator
find themselves at home, with their personal sense and
feeling, satisfied and liberated: to them the vision and
the consciousness of free spirit has been vouchsafed and
attained. Beautiful art, from its side, has thus performed
the same service as philosophy: it has purified the spirit
from its thraldom. The older religion in which the
<pb n='174'/><anchor id='Pg174'/>
need of fine art, and just for that reason, is first
generated, looks up in its principle to an other-world
which is sensuous and unmeaning: the images adored
by its devotees are hideous idols regarded as wonder-working
talismans, which point to the unspiritual
objectivity of that other world,&mdash;and bones perform a
similar or even a better service than such images.
But even fine art is only a grade of liberation, not the
supreme liberation itself.&mdash;The genuine objectivity,
which is only in the medium of thought,&mdash;the medium
in which alone the pure spirit is for the spirit, and
where the liberation is accompanied with reverence,&mdash;is
still absent in the sensuous beauty of the work of art,
still more in that external, unbeautiful sensuousness.
</p>

<p>
§ 563. Beautiful Art, like the religion peculiar to it,
has its future in true religion. The restricted value of
the Idea passes utterly and naturally into the universality
identical with the infinite form;&mdash;the vision in
which consciousness has to depend upon the senses
passes into a self-mediating knowledge, into an existence
which is itself knowledge,&mdash;into <emph>revelation</emph>. Thus
the principle which gives the Idea its content is that it
embody free intelligence, and as <q>absolute</q> <emph>spirit it
is for the spirit</emph>.

<p>
§ 564. It lies essentially in the notion of religion,&mdash;the
religion i.e. whose content is absolute mind&mdash;that
it be <emph>revealed</emph>, and, what is more, revealed <emph>by God</emph>.
Knowledge (the principle by which the substance is
mind) is a self-determining principle, as infinite self-realising
form,&mdash;it therefore is manifestation out and
out. The spirit is only spirit in so far as it is for the
spirit, and in the absolute religion it is the absolute
spirit which manifests no longer abstract elements of
its being but itself.
</p>

<p>
The old conception&mdash;due to a one-sided survey
of human life&mdash;of Nemesis, which made the divinity
and its action in the world only a levelling power,
dashing to pieces everything high and great,&mdash;was confronted
by Plato and Aristotle with the doctrine that
God is not <emph>envious</emph>. The same answer may be given to
the modern assertions that man cannot ascertain God.
These assertions (and more than assertions they are
not) are the more illogical, because made within a religion
which is expressly called the revealed; for
according to them it would rather be the religion in
which nothing of God was revealed, in which he had
not revealed himself, and those belonging to it would be
the heathen <q>who know not God.</q> If the word of God
<pb n='176'/><anchor id='Pg176'/>
is taken in earnest in religion at all, it is from Him, the
theme and centre of religion, that the method of divine
knowledge may and must begin: and if self-revelation
is refused Him, then the only thing left to constitute His
nature would be to ascribe envy to Him. But clearly if
the word Mind is to have a meaning, it implies the
revelation of Him.
</p>

<p>
If we recollect how intricate is the knowledge of
the divine Mind for those who are not content with the
homely pictures of faith but proceed to thought,&mdash;at
first only <q>rationalising</q> reflection, but afterwards, as
in duty bound, to speculative comprehension, it may
almost create surprise that so many, and especially theologians
whose vocation it is to deal with these Ideas,
have tried to get off their task by gladly accepting
anything offered them for this behoof. And nothing
serves better to shirk it than to adopt the conclusion
that man knows nothing of God. To know what
God as spirit is&mdash;to apprehend this accurately and
distinctly in thoughts&mdash;requires careful and thorough
speculation. It includes, in its fore-front, the propositions:
God is God only so far as he knows himself:
his self-knowledge is, further, his self-consciousness in
man, and man's knowledge <emph>of</emph> God, which proceeds to
man's self-knowledge in God.&mdash;See the profound elucidation
of these propositions in the work from which
they are taken: <hi rend='italic'>Aphorisms on Knowing and Not-knowing,
&amp;c.</hi>, by C. F. G&mdash;l.: Berlin 1829.
</p>

<p>
§ 565. When the immediacy and sensuousness of
shape and knowledge is superseded, God is, in point
of content, the essential and actual spirit of nature and
spirit, while in point of form he is, first of all, presented
to consciousness as a mental representation. This
quasi-pictorial representation gives to the elements of
his content, on one hand, a separate being, making them
<pb n='177'/><anchor id='Pg177'/>
presuppositions towards each other, and phenomena
which succeed each other; their relationship it makes
a series of events according to finite reflective categories.
But, on the other hand, such a form of finite representationalism
is also overcome and superseded in the faith
which realises one spirit and in the devotion of worship.
</p>

<p>
§ 566. In this separating, the form parts from the content:
and in the form the different functions of the
notion part off into special spheres or media, in each
of which the absolute spirit exhibits itself; (α) as
eternal content, abiding self-centred, even in its manifestation;
(β) as distinction of the eternal essence from
its manifestation, which by this difference becomes
the phenomenal world into which the content enters;
(γ) as infinite return, and reconciliation with the eternal
being, of the world it gave away&mdash;the withdrawal of
the eternal from the phenomenal into the unity of
its fullness.
</p>

<p>
§ 567. (α) Under the <q>moment</q> of <emph>Universality</emph>,&mdash;the
sphere of pure thought or the abstract medium of
essence,&mdash;it is therefore the absolute spirit, which is
at first the presupposed principle, not however staying
aloof and inert, but (as underlying and essential power
under the reflective category of causality) creator of
heaven and earth: but yet in this eternal sphere rather
only begetting himself as his <emph>son</emph>, with whom, though
different, he still remains in original identity,&mdash;just as,
again, this differentiation of him from the universal
essence eternally supersedes itself, and, though this
mediating of a self-superseding mediation, the first
substance is essentially as <emph>concrete individuality</emph> and
subjectivity,&mdash;is the <emph>Spirit</emph>.
</p>

<p>
§ 568. (β) Under the <q>moment</q> of <emph>particularity</emph>, or of
judgment, it is this concrete eternal being which is presupposed:
its movement is the creation of the phenomenal
<pb n='178'/><anchor id='Pg178'/>
world. The eternal <q>moment</q> of mediation&mdash;of the
only Son&mdash;divides itself to become the antithesis of
two separate worlds. On one hand is heaven and earth,
the elemental and the concrete nature,&mdash;on the other
hand, standing in action and reaction with such nature,
the spirit, which therefore is finite. That spirit, as the
extreme of inherent negativity, completes its independence
till it becomes wickedness, and is that extreme
through its connexion with a confronting nature and
through its own naturalness thereby investing it. Yet,
amid that naturalness, it is, when it thinks, directed
towards the Eternal, though, for that reason, only
standing to it in an external connexion.
</p>

<p>
§ 569. (γ) Under the <q>moment</q> of <emph>individuality</emph> as
such,&mdash;of subjectivity and the notion itself, in which
the contrast of universal and particular has sunk to its
identical ground, the place of presupposition (1) is taken
by the <emph>universal</emph> substance, as actualised out of its
abstraction into an <emph>individual</emph> self-consciousness. This
individual, who as such is identified with the essence,&mdash;(in
the Eternal sphere he is called the Son)&mdash;is
transplanted into the world of time, and in him wickedness
is implicitly overcome. Further, this immediate,
and thus sensuous, existence of the absolutely concrete
is represented as putting himself in judgment and
expiring in the pain of <emph>negativity</emph>, in which he, as infinite
subjectivity, keeps himself unchanged, and thus, as
absolute return from that negativity and as universal
unity of universal and individual essentiality, has
realised his being as the Idea of the spirit, eternal,
but alive and present in the world.
</p>

<p>
§ 570. (2) This objective totality of the divine man
who is the Idea of the spirit is the implicit presupposition
for the <emph>finite</emph> immediacy of the single subject.
For such subject therefore it is at first an Other, an object
<pb n='179'/><anchor id='Pg179'/>
of contemplating vision,&mdash;but the vision of implicit
truth, through which witness of the spirit in him, he,
on account of his immediate nature, at first characterised
himself as nought and wicked. But, secondly,
after the example of his truth, by means of the faith on
the unity (in that example implicitly accomplished) of
universal and individual essence, he is also the movement
to throw off his immediacy, his natural man and
self-will, to close himself in unity with that example
(who is his implicit life) in the pain of negativity, and
thus to know himself made one with the essential Being.
Thus the Being of Beings (3) through this mediation
brings about its own indwelling in self-consciousness,
and is the actual presence of the essential and self-subsisting
spirit who is all in all.
</p>

<p>
§ 571. These three syllogisms, constituting the one
syllogism of the absolute self-mediation of spirit, are
the revelation of that spirit whose life is set out as a cycle
of concrete shapes in pictorial thought. From this its
separation into parts, with a temporal and external
sequence, the unfolding of the mediation contracts itself
in the result,&mdash;where the spirit closes in unity with
itself,&mdash;not merely to the simplicity of faith and devotional
feeling, but even to thought. In the immanent
simplicity of thought the unfolding still has its expansion,
yet is all the while known as an indivisible coherence
of the universal, simple, and eternal spirit in itself. In
this form of truth, truth is the object of <emph>philosophy</emph>.
</p>

<p>
If the result&mdash;the realised Spirit in which all meditation
has superseded itself&mdash;is taken in a merely formal,
contentless sense, so that the spirit is not also at the
same time known as <emph>implicitly</emph> existent and objectively
self-unfolding;&mdash;then that infinite subjectivity is the
merely formal self-consciousness, knowing itself in itself
as absolute,&mdash;Irony. Irony, which can make every
<pb n='180'/><anchor id='Pg180'/>
objective reality nought and vain, is itself the emptiness
and vanity, which from itself, and therefore by
chance and its own good pleasure, gives itself direction
and content, remains master over it, is not bound
by it,&mdash;and, with the assertion that it stands on the
very summit of religion and philosophy, falls rather
back into the vanity of wilfulness. It is only in proportion
as the pure infinite form, the self-centred
manifestation, throws off the one-sidedness of subjectivity
in which it is the vanity of thought, that it is
the free thought which has its infinite characteristic
at the same time as essential and actual content, and
has that content as an object in which it is also free.
Thinking, so far, is only the formal aspect of the
absolute content.

<head>Sub-Section C. Philosophy.</head>

<p>
§ 572. This science is the unity of Art and Religion.
Whereas the vision-method of Art, external in point of
form, is but subjective production and shivers the substantial
content into many separate shapes, and whereas
Religion, with its separation into parts, opens it out in
mental picture, and mediates what is thus opened out;
Philosophy not merely keeps them together to make
a total, but even unifies them into the simple spiritual
vision, and then in that raises them to self-conscious
thought. Such consciousness is thus the intelligible
unity (cognised by thought) of art and religion, in which
the diverse elements in the content are cognised as
necessary, and this necessary as free.
</p>

<p>
§ 573. Philosophy thus characterises itself as a cognition
of the necessity in the content of the absolute
picture-idea, as also of the necessity in the two forms&mdash;on
one hand, immediate vision and its poetry, and
the objective and external revelation presupposed by
representation,&mdash;on the other hand, first the subjective
retreat inwards, then the subjective movement of faith
and its final identification with the presupposed object.
This cognition is thus the <emph>recognition</emph> of this content
and its form; it is the liberation from the one-sidedness
of the forms, elevation of them into the absolute form,
<pb n='182'/><anchor id='Pg182'/>
which determines itself to content, remains identical
with it, and is in that the cognition of that essential and
actual necessity. This movement, which philosophy is,
finds itself already accomplished, when at the close it
seizes its own notion,&mdash;i.e. only <emph>looks back</emph> on its
knowledge.
</p>

<p>
Here might seem to be the place to treat in a definite
exposition of the reciprocal relations of philosophy and
religion. The whole question turns entirely on the
difference of the forms of speculative thought from the
forms of mental representation and <q>reflecting</q> intellect.
But it is the whole cycle of philosophy, and of
logic in particular, which has not merely taught and
made known this difference, but also criticised it, or
rather has let its nature develop and judge itself by
these very categories. It is only by an insight into the
value of these forms that the true and needful conviction
can be gained, that the content of religion and philosophy
is the same,&mdash;leaving out, of course, the further details
of external nature and finite mind which fall outside
the range of religion. But religion is the truth <emph>for all
men</emph>: faith rests on the witness of the spirit, which
as witnessing is the spirit in man. This witness&mdash;the
underlying essence in all humanity&mdash;takes, when driven
to expound itself, its first definite form under those
acquired habits of thought which his secular consciousness
and intellect otherwise employs. In this way the
truth becomes liable to the terms and conditions of
finitude in general. This does not prevent the spirit,
even in employing sensuous ideas and finite categories
of thought, from retaining its content (which as religion
is essentially speculative,) with a tenacity which does
violence to them, and acts <emph>inconsistently</emph> towards them.
By this inconsistency it corrects their defects. Nothing
easier therefore for the <q>Rationalist</q> than to point out
<pb n='183'/><anchor id='Pg183'/>
contradictions in the exposition of the faith, and then to
prepare triumphs for its principle of formal identity. If
the spirit yields to this finite reflection, which has usurped
the title of reason and philosophy&mdash;(<q>Rationalism</q>)&mdash;it
strips religious truth of its infinity and makes it in reality
nought. Religion in that case is completely in the right
in guarding herself against such reason and philosophy
and treating them as enemies. But it is another thing
when religion sets herself against comprehending reason,
and against philosophy in general, and specially against
a philosophy of which the doctrine is speculative, and so
religious. Such an opposition proceeds from failure
to appreciate the difference indicated and the value of
spiritual form in general, and particularly of the logical
form; or, to be more precise, still from failure to note
the distinction of the content&mdash;which may be in both the
same&mdash;from these forms. It is on the ground of form
that philosophy has been reproached and accused by
the religious party; just as conversely its speculative
content has brought the same charges upon it from
a self-styled philosophy&mdash;and from a pithless orthodoxy.
It had too little of God in it for the former; too much
for the latter.
</p>

<p>
The charge of <emph>Atheism</emph>, which used often to be brought
against philosophy (that it has <emph>too little</emph> of God), has
grown rare: the more wide-spread grows the charge of
Pantheism, that it has <emph>too much</emph> of him:&mdash;so much so,
that it is treated not so much as an imputation, but as
a proved fact, or a sheer fact which needs no proof.
Piety, in particular, which with its pious airs of superiority
fancies itself free to dispense with proof, goes
hand in hand with empty rationalism&mdash;(which means to
be so much opposed to it, though both repose really on
the same habit of mind)&mdash;in the wanton assertion,
almost as if it merely mentioned a notorious fact, that
<pb n='184'/><anchor id='Pg184'/>
Philosophy is the All-one doctrine, or Pantheism. It
must be said that it was more to the credit of piety and
theology when they accused a philosophical system
(e.g. Spinozism) of Atheism than of Pantheism, though
the former imputation at the first glance looks more
cruel and insidious (cf. § 71 note). The imputation of
Atheism presupposes a definite idea of a full and real
God, and arises because the popular idea does not detect
in the philosophical notion the peculiar form to which
it is attached. Philosophy indeed can recognise its own
forms in the categories of religious consciousness, and
even its own teaching in the doctrine of religion&mdash;which
therefore it does not disparage. But the converse is not
true: the religious consciousness does not apply the
criticism of thought to itself, does not comprehend itself,
and is therefore, as it stands, exclusive. To impute
Pantheism instead of Atheism to Philosophy is part
of the modern habit of mind&mdash;of the new piety and
new theology. For them philosophy has too much
of God:&mdash;so much so, that, if we believe them, it asserts
that God is everything and everything is God. This
new theology, which makes religion only a subjective
feeling and denies the knowledge of the divine nature,
thus retains nothing more than a God in general without
objective characteristics. Without interest of its own
for the concrete, fulfilled notion of God, it treats it only
as an interest which <emph>others</emph> once had, and hence treats
what belongs to the doctrine of God's concrete nature
as something merely historical. The indeterminate
God is to be found in all religions; every kind of piety
(§ 72)&mdash;that of the Hindoo to asses, cows,&mdash;or to dalai-lamas,&mdash;that
of the Egyptians to the ox&mdash;is always
adoration of an object which, with all its absurdities,
also contains the generic abstract, God in General. If
this theory needs no more than such a God, so as to
<pb n='185'/><anchor id='Pg185'/>
find God in everything called religion, it must at least
find such a God recognised even in philosophy, and can
no longer accuse it of Atheism. The mitigation of the
reproach of Atheism into that of Pantheism has its
ground therefore in the superficial idea to which this
mildness has attenuated and emptied God. As that
popular idea clings to its abstract universality, from
which all definite quality is excluded, all such definiteness
is only the non-divine, the secularity of things,
thus left standing in fixed undisturbed substantiality.
On such a presupposition, even after philosophy has
maintained God's absolute universality, and the consequent
untruth of the being of external things, the
hearer clings as he did before to his belief that secular
things still keep their being, and form all that is definite
in the divine universality. He thus changes that
universality into what he calls the pantheistic:&mdash;<emph>Everything
is</emph>&mdash;(empirical things, without distinction, whether
higher or lower in the scale, <emph>are</emph>)&mdash;all possess substantiality;
and so&mdash;thus he understands philosophy&mdash;each
and every secular thing is God. It is only his own
stupidity, and the falsifications due to such misconception,
which generate the imagination and the allegation
of such pantheism.
</p>

<p>
But if those who give out that a certain philosophy is
Pantheism, are unable and unwilling to see this&mdash;for it
is just to see the notion that they refuse&mdash;they should
before everything have verified the alleged fact that
<emph>any one philosopher, or any one man</emph>, had really ascribed
substantial or objective and inherent reality to <emph>all</emph> things
and regarded them as God:&mdash;that such an idea had
ever come into the hand of any body but themselves.
This allegation I will further elucidate in this exoteric
discussion: and the only way to do so is to set down
the evidence. If we want to take so-called Pantheism
<pb n='186'/><anchor id='Pg186'/>
in its most poetical, most sublime, or if you will, its
grossest shape, we must, as is well known, consult the
oriental poets: and the most copious delineations of it
are found in Hindoo literature. Amongst the abundant
resources open to our disposal on this topic, I select&mdash;as
the most authentic statement accessible&mdash;the
Bhagavat-Gita, and amongst its effusions, prolix and
reiterative <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>ad nauseam</foreign>, some of the most telling passages.
In the 10th Lesson (in Schlegel, p. 162) Krishna
says of himself<note place='foot'>[The citation given by Hegel from Schlegel's translation is here
replaced by the version (in one or two points different) in the <hi rend='italic'>Sacred
Books of the East</hi>, vol. viii.]</note>:&mdash;<q>I am the self, seated in the hearts of
all beings. I am the beginning and the middle and the
end also of all beings ... I am the beaming sun
amongst the shining ones, and the moon among the
lunar mansions.... Amongst the Vedas I am the Sâma-Veda:
I am mind amongst the senses: I am consciousness
in living beings. And I am Sankara (Siva) among
the Rudras, ... Meru among the high-topped mountains,
... the Himalaya among the firmly-fixed (mountains)....
Among beasts I am the lord of beasts....
Among letters I am the letter A.... I am the spring
among the seasons.... I am also that which is the seed
of all things: there is nothing moveable or immoveable
which can exist without me.</q>
</p>

<p>
Even in these totally sensuous delineations, Krishna
(and we must not suppose there is, besides Krishna,
still God, or a God besides; as he said before he was
Siva, or Indra, so it is afterwards said that Brahma
too is in him) makes himself out to be&mdash;not everything,
but only&mdash;the most excellent of everything.
Everywhere there is a distinction drawn between
external, unessential existences, and one essential
amongst them, which he is. Even when, at the beginning
<pb n='187'/><anchor id='Pg187'/>
of the passage, he is said to be the beginning,
middle, and end of living things, this totality is distinguished
from the living things themselves as single
existences. Even such a picture which extends deity far
and wide in its existence cannot be called pantheism: we
must rather say that in the infinitely multiple empirical
world, everything is reduced to a limited number of
essential existences, to a polytheism. But even what
has been quoted shows that these very substantialities
of the externally-existent do not retain the independence
entitling them to be named Gods; even Siva, Indra, &amp;c.
melt into the one Krishna.
</p>

<p>
This reduction is more expressly made in the following
scene (7th Lesson, p. 7 sqq.). Krishna says: <q>I am
the producer and the destroyer of the whole universe.
There is nothing else higher than myself; all this is
woven upon me, like numbers of pearls upon a thread.
I am the taste in water;... I am the light of the sun
and the moon; I am <q>Om</q> in all the Vedas.... I am
life in all beings.... I am the discernment of the discerning
ones.... I am also the strength of the strong.</q>
Then he adds: <q>The whole universe deluded by these
three states of mind developed from the qualities [sc.
goodness, passion, darkness] does not know me who
am beyond them and inexhaustible: for this delusion of
mine,</q> [even the Maya is <emph>his</emph>, nothing independent],
<q>developed from the qualities is divine and difficult to
transcend. Those cross beyond this delusion who
resort to me alone.</q> Then the picture gathers itself
up in a simple expression: <q>At the end of many lives,
the man possessed of knowledge approaches me, (believing)
that Vasudeva is everything. Such a high-souled
mind is very hard to find. Those who are
deprived of knowledge by various desires approach other
divinities... Whichever form of deity one worships with
<pb n='188'/><anchor id='Pg188'/>
faith, from it he obtains the beneficial things he desires
really given by me. But the fruit thus obtained by those
of little judgment is perishable.... The undiscerning
ones, not knowing my transcendent and inexhaustible
essence, than which there is nothing higher, think
me who am unperceived to have become perceptible.</q>
</p>

<p>
This <q>All,</q> which Krishna calls himself, is not, any
more than the Eleatic One, and the Spinozan Substance,
the Every-thing. This every-thing, rather, the
infinitely-manifold sensuous manifold of the finite is in
all these pictures, but defined as the <q>accidental,</q> without
essential being of its very own, but having its truth
in the substance, the One which, as different from that
accidental, is alone the divine and God. Hindooism
however has the higher conception of Brahma, the
pure unity of thought in itself, where the empirical
everything of the world, as also those proximate substantialities,
called Gods, vanish. On that account
Colebrooke and many others have described the Hindoo
religion as at bottom a Monotheism. That this description
is not incorrect is clear from these short
citations. But so little concrete is this divine unity&mdash;spiritual
as its idea of God is&mdash;so powerless its grip,
so to speak&mdash;that Hindooism, with a monstrous inconsistency,
is also the maddest of polytheisms. But the
idolatry of the wretched Hindoo, when he adores the
ape, or other creature, is still a long way from that
wretched fancy of a Pantheism, to which everything is
God, and God everything. Hindoo monotheism moreover
is itself an example how little comes of mere
monotheism, if the Idea of God is not deeply determinate
in itself. For that unity, if it be intrinsically abstract
and therefore empty, tends of itself to let whatever is
concrete, outside it&mdash;be it as a lot of Gods or as secular,
empirical individuals&mdash;keep its independence. That pantheism
<pb n='189'/><anchor id='Pg189'/>
indeed&mdash;on the shallow conception of it&mdash;might
with a show of logic as well be called a monotheism:
for if God, as it says, is identical with the world, then
as there is only one world there would be in that
pantheism only one God. Perhaps the empty numerical
unity must be predicated of the world: but such
abstract predication of it has no further special interest;
on the contrary, a mere numerical unity just means that
its <emph>content</emph> is an infinite multeity and variety of finitudes.
But it is that delusion with the empty unity,
which alone makes possible and induces the wrong idea
of pantheism. It is only the picture&mdash;floating in the
indefinite blue&mdash;of the world as <emph>one thing</emph>, <emph>the all</emph>, that
could ever be considered capable of combining with
God: only on that assumption could philosophy be
supposed to teach that God is the world: for if the
world were taken as it is, as everything, as the endless
lot of empirical existence, then it would hardly have
been even held possible to suppose a pantheism which
asserted of such stuff that it is God.
</p>

<p>
But to go back again to the question of fact. If we
want to see the consciousness of the One&mdash;not as with
the Hindoos split between the featureless unity of
abstract thought, on one hand, and on the other, the
long-winded weary story of its particular detail, but&mdash;in
its finest purity and sublimity, we must consult the
Mohammedans. If e.g. in the excellent Jelaleddin-Rumi
in particular, we find the unity of the soul with
the One set forth, and that unity described as love,
this spiritual unity is an exaltation above the finite and
vulgar, a transfiguration of the natural and the spiritual,
in which the externalism and transitoriness of immediate
nature, and of empirical secular spirit, is discarded
and absorbed<note place='foot'><p>In order to give a clearer impression of it, I cannot refrain from
quoting a few passages, which may at the same time give some
indication of the marvellous skill of Rückert, from whom they are
taken, as a translator. [For Rückert's verses a version is here
substituted in which I have been kindly helped by Miss May Kendall.]

In this poetry, which soars over all that is external and sensuous,
who would recognise the prosaic ideas current about so-called
pantheism&mdash;ideas which let the divine sink to the external and
the sensuous? The copious extracts which Tholuck, in his work
<hi rend='italic'>Anthology from the Eastern Mystics</hi>, gives us from the poems of
Jelaleddin and others, are made from the very point of view now
under discussion. In his Introduction, Herr Tholuck proves how
profoundly his soul has caught the note of mysticism; and there,
too, he points out the characteristic traits of its oriental phase, in
distinction from that of the West and Christendom. With all their
divergence, however, they have in common the mystical character. The
conjunction of Mysticism with so-called Pantheism, as he says (p. 53),
implies that inward quickening of soul and spirit which inevitably
tends to annihilate that external <emph>Everything</emph>, which Pantheism is
usually held to adore. But beyond that, Herr Tholuck leaves
matters standing at the usual indistinct conception of Pantheism;
a profounder discussion of it would have had, for the author's
emotional Christianity, no direct interest; but we see that personally
he is carried away by remarkable enthusiasm for a mysticism
which, in the ordinary phrase, entirely deserves the epithet Pantheistic.
Where, however, he tries philosophising (p. 12), he does
not get beyond the standpoint of the <q>rationalist</q> metaphysic with
its uncritical categories.</p></note>.
</p>

<pb n='190'/><anchor id='Pg190'/>

<p>
I refrain from accumulating further examples of the
religious and poetic conceptions which it is customary
to call pantheistic. Of the philosophies to which that
name is given, the Eleatic, or Spinozist, it has been
<pb n='191'/><anchor id='Pg191'/>
remarked earlier (§ 50, note) that so far are they from
identifying God with the world and making him finite,
that in these systems this <q>everything</q> has no truth,
and that we should rather call them monotheistic, or, in
relation to the popular idea of the world, acosmical.
<pb n='192'/><anchor id='Pg192'/>
They are most accurately called systems which apprehend
the Absolute only as substance. Of the oriental,
especially the Mohammedan, modes of envisaging God,
we may rather say that they represent the Absolute as
the utterly universal genus which dwells in the species
or existences, but dwells so potently that these existences
have no actual reality. The fault of all these
modes of thought and systems is that they stop short of
defining substance as subject and as mind.
</p>

<p>
These systems and modes of pictorial conception
originate from the one need common to all philosophies
and all religions of getting an idea of God, and,
secondly, of the relationship of God and the world.
(In philosophy it is specially made out that the determination
of God's nature determines his relations with
the world.) The <q>reflective</q> understanding begins by
rejecting all systems and modes of conception, which,
whether they spring from heart, imagination or speculation,
express the interconnexion of God and the
world: and in order to have God pure in faith or consciousness,
he is as essence parted from appearance,
as infinite from the finite. But, after this partition, the
conviction arises also that the appearance has a relation
to the essence, the finite to the infinite, and so on: and
thus arises the question of reflection as to the nature
of this relation. It is in the reflective form that the
whole difficulty of the affair lies, and that causes this
relation to be called incomprehensible by the agnostic.
The close of philosophy is not the place, even in
a general exoteric discussion, to waste a word on
what a <q>notion</q> means. But as the view taken of this
relation is closely connected with the view taken of
philosophy generally and with all imputations against
it, we may still add the remark that though philosophy
certainly has to do with unity in general, it is not however
<pb n='193'/><anchor id='Pg193'/>
with abstract unity, mere identity, and the empty
absolute, but with concrete unity (the notion), and that
in its whole course it has to do with nothing else;&mdash;that
each step in its advance is a peculiar term or phase of
this concrete unity, and that the deepest and last
expression of unity is the unity of absolute mind itself.
Would-be judges and critics of philosophy might be
recommended to familiarise themselves with these
phases of unity and to take the trouble to get acquainted
with them, at least to know so much that of these terms
there are a great many, and that amongst them there
is great variety. But they show so little acquaintance
with them&mdash;and still less take trouble about it&mdash;that,
when they hear of unity&mdash;and relation <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>ipso facto</foreign> implies
unity&mdash;they rather stick fast at quite abstract indeterminate
unity, and lose sight of the chief point of interest&mdash;the
special mode in which the unity is qualified.
Hence all they can say about philosophy is that dry
identity is its principle and result, and that it is the
system of identity. Sticking fast to the undigested
thought of identity, they have laid hands on, not the
concrete unity, the notion and content of philosophy,
but rather its reverse. In the philosophical field they
proceed, as in the physical field the physicist; who also
is well aware that he has before him a variety of sensuous
properties and matters&mdash;or usually matters alone,
(for the properties get transformed into matters also
for the physicist)&mdash;and that these matters (elements)
<emph>also</emph> stand in <emph>relation</emph> to one another. But the question
is, Of what kind is this relation? Every peculiarity
and the whole difference of natural things, inorganic
and living, depend solely on the different modes of
this unity. But instead of ascertaining these different
modes, the ordinary physicist (chemist included) takes
up only one, the most external and the worst, viz.
<pb n='194'/><anchor id='Pg194'/>
<emph>composition</emph>, applies only it in the whole range of natural
structures, which he thus renders for ever inexplicable.
</p>

<p>
The aforesaid shallow pantheism is an equally obvious
inference from this shallow identity. All that those who
employ this invention of their own to accuse philosophy
gather from the study of God's <emph>relation</emph> to the world is
that the one, but only the one factor of this category
of relation&mdash;and that the factor of indeterminateness&mdash;is
identity. Thereupon they stick fast in this half-perception,
and assert&mdash;falsely as a fact&mdash;that philosophy
teaches the identity of God and the world. And as in
their judgment either of the two,&mdash;the world as much
as God&mdash;has the same solid substantiality as the other,
they infer that in the philosophic Idea God is <emph>composed</emph>
of God and the world. Such then is the idea they form
of pantheism, and which they ascribe to philosophy.
Unaccustomed in their own thinking and apprehending
of thoughts to go beyond such categories, they import
them into philosophy, where they are utterly unknown;
they thus infect it with the disease against which they
subsequently raise an outcry. If any difficulty emerge
in comprehending God's relation to the world, they at
once and very easily escape it by admitting that this
relation contains for them an inexplicable contradiction;
and that hence, they must stop at the vague conception
of such relation, perhaps under the more familiar names
of, e.g. omnipresence, providence, &amp;c. Faith in their use
of the term means no more than a refusal to define the
conception, or to enter on a closer discussion of the problem.
That men and classes of untrained intellect are
satisfied with such indefiniteness, is what one expects;
but when a trained intellect and an interest for reflective
study is satisfied, in matters admitted to be of superior,
if not even of supreme interest, with indefinite ideas, it
is hard to decide whether the thinker is really in earnest
<pb n='195'/><anchor id='Pg195'/>
with the subject. But if those who cling to this crude
<q>rationalism</q> were in earnest, e.g. with God's omnipresence,
so far as to realise their faith thereon in
a definite mental idea, in what difficulties would they
be involved by their belief in the true reality of the things
of sense! They would hardly like, as Epicurus does, to
let God dwell in the interspaces of things, i.e. in the
pores of the physicists,&mdash;said pores being the negative,
something supposed to exist <emph>beside</emph> the material reality.
This very <q>Beside</q> would give their pantheism its
spatiality,&mdash;their everything, conceived as the mutual exclusion
of parts in space. But in ascribing to God, in his
relation to the world, an action on and in the space thus
filled on the world and in it, they would endlessly split
up the divine actuality into infinite materiality. They
would really thus have the misconception they call pantheism
or all-one-doctrine, only as the necessary sequel
of their misconceptions of God and the world. But to put
that sort of thing, this stale gossip of oneness or identity,
on the shoulders of philosophy, shows such recklessness
about justice and truth that it can only be explained
through the difficulty of getting into the head thoughts
and notions, i.e. not abstract unity, but the many-shaped
modes specified. If statements as to facts are put forward,
and the facts in question are thoughts and notions, it is
indispensable to get hold of their meaning. But even the
fulfilment of this requirement has been rendered superfluous,
now that it has long been a foregone conclusion
that philosophy is pantheism, a system of identity, an
All-one doctrine, and that the person therefore who
might be unaware of this fact is treated either as merely
unaware of a matter of common notoriety, or as prevaricating
for a purpose. On account of this chorus of
assertions, then, I have believed myself obliged to speak
at more length and exoterically on the outward and
<pb n='196'/><anchor id='Pg196'/>
inward untruth of this alleged fact: for exoteric discussion
is the only method available in dealing with the
external apprehension of notions as mere facts,&mdash;by
which notions are perverted into their opposite. The
esoteric study of God and identity, as of cognitions and
notions, is philosophy itself.
</p>

<p>
§ 574. This notion of philosophy is the self-thinking
Idea, the truth aware of itself (§ 236),&mdash;the logical
system, but with the signification that it is universality
approved and certified in concrete content as in its
actuality. In this way the science has gone back to its
beginning: its result is the logical system but as
a spiritual principle: out of the presupposing judgment,
in which the notion was only implicit and the beginning
an immediate,&mdash;and thus out of the <emph>appearance</emph> which
it had there&mdash;it has risen into its pure principle and
thus also into its proper medium.
</p>

<p>
<anchor id='Section_575'/>
§ 575. It is this appearing which originally gives the
motive of the further development. The first appearance
is formed by the syllogism, which is based on the
Logical system as starting-point, with Nature for the
middle term which couples the Mind with it. The
Logical principle turns to Nature and Nature to Mind.
Nature, standing between the Mind and its essence,
sunders itself, not indeed to extremes of finite abstraction,
nor itself to something away from them and independent,&mdash;which,
as other than they, only serves as a link
between them: for the syllogism is <emph>in the Idea</emph> and Nature
is essentially defined as a transition-point and negative
factor, and as implicitly the Idea. Still the mediation
of the notion has the external form of <emph>transition</emph>, and the
science of Nature presents itself as the course of
necessity, so that it is only in the one extreme that the
liberty of the notion is explicit as a self-amalgamation.
</p>

<p>
<anchor id='Section_576'/>
§ 576. In the second syllogism this appearance is so
<pb n='197'/><anchor id='Pg197'/>
far superseded, that that syllogism is the standpoint of
the Mind itself, which&mdash;as the mediating agent in the
process&mdash;presupposes Nature and couples it with the
Logical principle. It is the syllogism where Mind
reflects on itself in the Idea: philosophy appears as
a subjective cognition, of which liberty is the aim, and
which is itself the way to produce it.
</p>

<p>
§ 577. The third syllogism is the Idea of philosophy,
which has self-knowing reason, the absolutely-universal,
for its middle term: a middle, which divides itself into
Mind and Nature, making the former its presupposition,
as process of the Idea's subjective activity, and the latter
its universal extreme, as process of the objectively and
implicitly existing Idea. The self-judging of the Idea
into its two appearances (§§ <ref target='Section_575'>575</ref>, <ref target='Section_576'>576</ref>) characterises both
as its (the self-knowing reason's) manifestations: and in
it there is a unification of the two aspects:&mdash;it is the
nature of the fact, the notion, which causes the movement
and development, yet this same movement is
equally the action of cognition. The eternal Idea, in
full fruition of its essence, eternally sets itself to work,
engenders and enjoys itself as absolute Mind.
