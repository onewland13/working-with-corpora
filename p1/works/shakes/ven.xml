          your lordship, nor how the world will censure me for choosing so
          strong a prop to support so weak a burden: only if your honor seem but
          pleased, I account myself highly praised, and vow to take advantage of
          all idle hours, till I have honored you with some graver labor. But if
          the first heir of my invention prove deformed, I shall be sorry it had
          so noble a god-father, and never after ear so barren a land, for fear
          it yield me still so bad a harvest. I leave it to your honor- able
          survey, and your honor to your heart's content; which I wish may
          always answer your own wish and the world's hopeful expectation. </p>
