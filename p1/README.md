# Project 1, Part 1: Identifying Male and Female Characters and Exploring their language

## Rough Sketch of Steps: 

1. Download all appropriate files, determine which we will be using
2. Be able to extract characters from each file
3. For each character, extract each sentence they have that has some minimum number of words in it
4. Come up with a non-trivial golden source of truth for training and testing
5. Load the word vector models using Genism
6. For each sentence, build an array of wordVectors for each word in the sentence
7. Using this algorithm, test our testing data
8. For each sentence's word vectors, run it through the cloud computing shit
